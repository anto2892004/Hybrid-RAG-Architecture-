Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year , reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites . The sites ' TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile , which carries higher TAC , partially offset by the growth in TAC-free sites revenues primarily from YouTube . In Q3 , the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift .

At Google , we 've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference , like indexing the world 's information to make it discoverable . We have focused a lot on really improving Search and Mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways . This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing , computer vision , Knowledge Graph and other areas .

Non-cash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement , but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits .
