It is really one of the best ways to achieve post Moore 's law error of computing acceleration , and a lot of ( inaudible ) competition . And the one that , of course , that is very big deal is deep learning and machine learning . This particular field is a brand-new , new way of doing computing for a large number of companies , and we 're seeing traction all over the place . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 9 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Next question , Steven Chin , UBS . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-May-12", "chunk_index": 18, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-May-12-NVDA.txt"}}

We are seeing great traction in gaming . Gaming as you know , has multiple growth drivers covers . But partly of the gaming is growing , because the production value of game is growing , partly because the number of people who are playing is growing . E-sports is more popular sport than ever , sports spectatorship is more popular than ever . And so , gaming is just a larger and larger market , and it 's surprising everybody . And the quality of games is going up , which means that the complexity of GPUs has to go up . High-performance computing has grown , and the killer app is machine learning and deep learning . And that 's going to continue to go into production from the hyperscale companies , as we expand our region to enterprises all over the world now . Companies who have a great deal of data that they would like to ( inaudible ) . Automotive is growing , and we 're delighted to see that the enterprise is growing as well . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Steven Chin , UBS - Analyst [ 12 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-May-12", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-May-12-NVDA.txt"}}

And just kind wondering looking further across the year , whether you have -- whether or not that the levers that you have available to you currently , if there 's further room for expansion , whether it is from product mix , higher ASPs , and or maybe some of the platform-related elements such as software services ?

As we look to Q2 , a good review of where we also see gross margins , and those are looking at a non-GAAP at about 58 % . So , again , be a strong component of that . As the launch of Pascal will come out with high-end gaming and with datacenter , and the growth essentially across all of our platforms will help our overall gross margins . As we go forward , there is still continued work to do . We 're here to guide just one quarter out , but we do have a large TAM in front of us on many of these different markets , and the mix will certainly help us . We 're in the initial stages of rolling out what we have in software services , our overall systems . So I do n't expect it to be a material part of the overall gross margin , but it will definitely be a great value proposition for us , for what we put forth . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 14 ] -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-May-12", "chunk_index": 22, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-May-12-NVDA.txt"}}

Yields are good and building these semiconductor devices are always hard , but we 're very good at it . And this is now -- a year behind when the first 16 nanometer finFET products went into production at TSMC . They have yields under great control .

The thing that 's most important , is that the value is greater than ever . And one of the things that we know is games are becoming richer than ever , production value has become richer than ever . And gamers want to play these games with all of the settings maxed out . They would like to play at a very high resolution , and they want to play it at very high frame rates . When I announced 1080 , I was showing all of the latest , the most demanding games running at twice the resolution of a game console , at twice the frame rate of the game console , and it was barely even breathing hard . And so , I think one of the most important things is for customers of this segment , they want to buy a product that they can count on , and that they can rely on to be ready for the future generation games . And some of the most important future generation games are going to be in VR . And so , the resolution is going to be even higher , the frame rate expectation is 90 hertz , and", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-May-12", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-May-12-NVDA.txt"}}

I think a lot -- the answer to a lot of your questions is I do n't know . However , there are some things I do know very well . One of the things that we do know is that high-performance computing is an essential approach for one of the most important computing models that we know today , which is machine learning and deep learning . Hyperscale datacenters all over the world is relying on this new model of computing , so that it can harvest , it could study all of the vast amounts of data that we 're getting to find insight for individual customers , make the perfect recommendation , predict when somebody would anticipate , would look forward to in terms of news or products or whatever it is . And so , this approach of using computing is really unprecedented , and this is a new computing model , and the GPU is really ideal for it . And we have been working on this for coming up on a decade . And it explains one of the reasons why we have such a great lead in this particular aspect . The GPU is really the ideal processor , if you use massively parallel problems .

On the other hand , I really appreciate you asking about the inferencing We , recently -- well , this year , several months ago we announced the Tesla M4 that was designed for inferencing . And it 's a little tiny graphics card , a little tiny processor , and it 's less than 50 watts . It 's called the M4 . And at GTC , I announced a brand-new compiler called the GPU inference engine , GIE . And GIE recompiles the network that was trained , so that it can be optimumly inferenced at the lowest possible energy . And so , not only are we already 50 watts , which is low power , we can also now inference at a higher energy efficiency , than any processor that we know today , better than any CPU by a very long shot , better than any FPGA .

I hate to ruin all of the surprises for you , but Pascal is the single most ambitious GPU architecture we have ever undertaken .

It was designed to take into consideration , all of the things that we 've learned about deep learning , all of the things that we 've learned about VR . For example , it has a brand-new graphics pipeline that allows Pascal to simultaneously project into multiple surfaces at the same time , with no performance penalty , that otherwise , it would degrade your performance in VR by factor by a factor of 2 , just because you have two surfaces you 're projecting into . And then , we can do all kinds of amazing things for augmented reality , other types of virtual", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-May-12", "chunk_index": 52, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-May-12-NVDA.txt"}}

Quarterly growth was broad-based , with expansion across each of our four market platforms -- gaming , professional visualization , datacenter and automotive . Pacing gains were our GTX gaming platform , our datacenter platform , powered by deep learning , growing adoption and automotive . Viewed from a reporting segment perspective , Q4 GP revenue grew 10 % to $ 1.18 billion from a year earlier . Tegra Processor revenue was up 40 % to $ 157 million . NVIDIA 's strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets . Our progress stems from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets .

Gaming revenue grossed 25 % year on year to $ 810 million , with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter . Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processors continue to lead our gaming growth , combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games . The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world 's most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform . And we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming notebooks . That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks , which has enabled a new category -- enthusiast-class VR-capable gaming notebooks . Excitement is growing around VR gaming , a key theme of last month 's Consumer Electronics Show . We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience . And Oculus , which has now opened pre-orders for the Rift headsets , has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR . GeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles , and that again proved true this past holiday season . Fallout 4 was among the standouts , recording more than $ 750 million in sales in its first 24 hours . Other major hits were Star Wars Battlefront , Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 and Rainbow Six .

At the end of January , just 2.5 years after its introduction , GeForce Experience subscribers stood at $ 76 million , up 37 % on the year . Moving to professional visualization . Quadro revenue increased 7 % , both sequentially and year over year , to $ 203 million . The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter , driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market . While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play , we are also excited by its potential in enterprise , particularly in areas such as medicine , architecture , education , and product design . Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms , with several hundred expected later this year , that lets customers experience new models , customize them in real-time , and take them for a virtual spin . In a very different application , a startup called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient 's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut . In datacenter , inclusive of Tesla and GRID , revenue rose 18 % sequentially to a record $ 97 million , up 10 % year on year .

During the quarter , we launched key products for this market . And a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform . A key development came during November 's Supercomputing 2015 Conference , with the release of the latest list of the worlds top 500 fastest supercomputers . It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators . Two-thirds of these use NVIDIA accelerators , up 50 % on the year . For hyper-scaled datacenters , we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning . It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40 , the most powerful accelerator designed for training deep [ nolla ] networks , and the NVIDIA Tesla M4 , a low-power small form-factor accelerator for machine learning inference . Web services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend . Shortly after our hyper-scale announcement , Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40s to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications .

Automotive revenue was a record $ 93 million , up 18 % sequentially , and up 68 % year over year . One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 self-driving car platform , which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving . As many of you saw , DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunchbox that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second , and delivers 8 teraflops of processing power , equivalent to that of 150 [ metso pros ] .

Volvo , well-known for its safety and reliability , will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2 , using it as the brain force fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg , Sweden . Just a couple weeks ago , the first autonomous shuttle , the WEpod , incorporating our deep learning platform , took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands , where it can be summoned with a smart phone app . The DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers , Tier 1 suppliers , and others . We are now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies . Finally , our OEM and IP business was $ 198 million , up 3 % sequentially , driven by the seasonal demand for notebooks . Now turning to the rest of the income statement . GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5 % . Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2 % , slightly above our outlook . GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago .

My first question , Jen-Hsun , is on the gaming segment . For the last two years , it has grown at over 30 % a year . I do n't know many other multi-billion-dollar businesses and semis that are growing at this pace . The question really is , how sustainable is this growth ? I understand the drivers .

First of all , I think you captured the essence of it in your question . GeForce is really not a chip business anymore ; it is really a gaming platform business . When you think about it from a gaming platform business , it has to be thought of in the context of the low gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry . It is $ 100 billion large . When you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way , I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant . There are several different ways we can grow the market . First of all , when we introduce new game platforms -- and this last couple of years , we 've introduced Maxwell , it 's the most successful gaming platform we have ever introduced . The installed base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform . Another reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase , the graphics richness continues to increase . And we do that by inspiring the industry , providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way . And the way that we do that is called GameWorks . All the physical simulations , all of the visual simulations , all the lighting simulations and all of the things that makes games beautiful", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Feb-17", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Feb-17-NVDA.txt"}}

All the physical simulations , all of the visual simulations , all the lighting simulations and all of the things that makes games beautiful today are easy to include by just supporting GameWorks . It has been an enormous success for us . And of course , developing companies are still doing incredibly well . There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming . Southeast Asia is growing incredibly . And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming . Gaming is all about sports now . But we 're starting to see a new culture and a new dynamic in gaming even beyond that . It 's really becoming a platform by which people could share , and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves . If you look at some of these games today , it 's something you enjoy well-beyond just playing the game . You use the game as an editor to tell stories . And so these games like GTA 5 , it 's just fantastic for telling stories . And so you can see now that the gaming platform is going beyond games , it 's going beyond sports , and now it is a creative platform . So there are just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant .

And as a follow-up , Jen-Hsun , on your automotive business , as you move from entertainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems , do you think it changes the competitive environment ? And what I am referring to is , we have seen Qualcomm and others enter the segment , and they are making the case they can integrate a lot of different [ piece ] parts and tie back to their processor .

Our high-performance computing business uses an architecture we call accelerated computing . Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago . It 's a very unique way of computing , and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU , as well as the advantage of the world 's most parallel processor , called the GPU . It is very software-intensive , it is very mathematics-intensive , it 's very algorithm-intensive . It 's a problem that , when applied to some verticals , can accelerate computing dramatically . We see accelerations of 5x , 10x , 20x , quite normally , quite regularly . And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their costs . Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $ 500 million , this supercomputer would be the world 's best at $ 100 million . That 's a pretty substantial reduction in expenses . The power-build that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced . So datacenters and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money . On the other hand , the researchers see a substantial boost in their application throughput . So that is one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well . We are seeing a couple of different drivers", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Feb-17", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Feb-17-NVDA.txt"}}

It 's really going to see some great adoption . I think we mentioned that in just a couple of years ago , we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning , and now it has ballooned to 3,500 . That is quite a large-scale growth .

It 's unfortunate that the business courts could n't see through the obviously complex data associated with the technology . But we are disappointed by it . We have appealed for a review , and hopefully , in the near term , we will discover what the ITC will do .

But it 's very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end-user feature . The partners that we worked with , the car companies we worked with , to computerize their cars , whether it is Audi or Tesla , whose cars are heavily computerized . Their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good . So I think that 's one . We have a clear view of the pipeline , and I think the mega-trends of the computerization of cars is in our favor . Now you mention -- secondarily , we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX . It is our economist-driving car computer platform . And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS and what 's beyond ADAS is self-driving cars .

Part of the answer is , I 'm not sure . So with that as a disclaimer , let me tell you why I 'm so enthusiastic about it . There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve which , algorithmically , is just impossible to solve . There is no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society . And it could be almost any problem . It can be weather-related-type problems . It could be market-related-type problems . It could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges , and all kinds of data . It could be life sciences , as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time , that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science . There are so many different types of areas where there is no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature . So in that particular case , using an enormous amount of data to train the neural net , to train software , to rewrite the software , if you will , using an enormous amount of computation , is a pretty exciting computation model . I think this is a brand-new computing model , one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming . This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model . In this particular case , GPU accelerated computing is really quite ideal and the computing model that we", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Feb-17", "chunk_index": 37, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Feb-17-NVDA.txt"}}

I think that it could be quite significant . And we are starting to see , of course , the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon . They are great companies , from Google to Facebook to Vidu to IBM to Alibaba , to just about every hyperscale web services company in the world , is jumping on this . Because they have enormous amounts of data and it has very , very long tails . And traditional segmentation is too contrived of an approach to find great insight . Now that the companies with a great deal of web-based data , cloud-based data , have already starting to engage in this area , they are starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another . I think we already heard them announce that it 's very likely they will put artificial intelligence into every single application they have . We are starting to see this sweep across industries . The automotive industry , of course , has the longest tail , as the world is a very noisy place . And in order to create a car that can navigate through it , the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow . Writing software programs is just not going to do it . So using an ongoing learning artificial intelligence network", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Feb-17", "chunk_index": 38, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Feb-17-NVDA.txt"}}

Life sciences , industries , manufacturing , supercomputing , financial services -- the list goes on and on . And we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm . Before everybody can use deep learning , they have to train a network . And this is an area where we have a great deal of expertise . This year , as you know , we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine . It 's our first end-to-end training-to-inferencing -- inferencing is predictions , the application of the network . So from training all the way to inferencing , we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible . The Tesla M40 is for training , and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing . The M4 is a little , tiny credit card-sized GPU , and very low-power , incredibly energy-efficient . And you can connect it into just about any hyperscale datacenter in the world . And we are sampling customers now . The results are quite exciting . Customers are very enthusiastic about it . I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of datacenters all over the world , as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Feb-17", "chunk_index": 39, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Feb-17-NVDA.txt"}}

Here is my guess . I think long term , training will be half of the overall market . And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight . And in the long term -- well , not long term now -- you 're training your network constantly . You create a network . You want to improve this network as fast as you can , because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after . And you deploy the network for inferencing , which collects brand-new data . And the world looks completely different to you . You now collect that data , and you use that data to train your network . I think that network training is going to be continuous basis , and we 're seeing that , absolutely . Also there are more types of networks . The type of networks that are being created , the rate of revolution , the rate of innovation of networks -- network styles , network types , network configurations , network depths .

Jen-Hsun , you talked about the installed base and the upgrade opportunity in gaming , I think , last call . You quantified it as around three-quarters of the installed base that really needs a more updated GTX processor . Given the 37 % growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell , it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the installed base . So the question for you is , is there any updates to your views on where the installed base sits at from that upgrade opportunity ?

Jen-Hsun , there 's been a lot of speculation about how the emergence of VR headsets , in particular for gaming , would drive your GPU business . I guess I would like to hear your perspective on a couple of things . One , obviously it requires high-end and high GPU use to support some of these applications . So of the early adopters , maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those type of GPUs , and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term ? And second , how VR might penetrate the [ East Forts ] phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market ?

I might also explain that the ASP of our overall portfolio increasing . I think the reason why it 's increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content , rich production value in graphics , which they did n't used to be able to do . They now have the benefit of a large installed base , a PlayStation an Xbox , a Nintendo and PCs , that they could actually create content that is really , really quite beautiful and technologically rich . Which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs , because you need higher-end GPUs to process it . I think that is quite a significant factor . I think the other factor is that the game consoles , although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs , on average , is higher in terms of capability than our average installed base . That is actually terrific news for us , because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles , which all of them are , now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least a game console experience .

You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience . But the way to think about it long term is that , as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream , there is no question in my mind that our $ 100 and $ 150 GeForce GTX cards will , in the future , be able to play VR just perfectly . So this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology . As we know , technology continues to advance , and whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term . Whatever the Sony PlayStation does , I think is just fantastic either way . What we would like to do is get people excited about VR . And in the final analysis , there are TV gamers and then there are -- there are console gamers and there are PC gamers . They are different genres , and they are different applications and different styles , and very largely different customers . So I think we are just enthusiastic about VR , period .

That 's number one . Number two , I believe that long term , our car company , the soul of the car company is the driving experience of that car . The soul of the company is the safety record of that car . The soul of the company is the functionality of that car . In the future , the functionality , the safety , the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software-defined . It 's going to be artificial intelligence network-defined . I just ca n't imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and all of the world -- Toyota , and the list goes on -- and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace . I just ca n't imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company . That is a second philosophical belief .

Notice that our platform is completely programmable . We have rich tools . We know that developers all over the world can easily buy themselves a GeForce TITAN and write CUDA applications . And those CUDA applications will tomorrow run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly .

We had a strong start to the year , highlighting our record first quarter with a near tripling of Datacenter revenue , reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence . Overall , quarterly revenue reached $ 1.94 billion , up 48 % from a year earlier , down 11 % sequentially and above our outlook of $ 1.9 billion . Growth remained broad-based with year-on-year gains in each of our 4 platforms : Gaming , Professional Visualization , Datacenter and Automotive . From a reporting segment perspective , Q1 GPU revenue grew 45 % to $ 1.56 billion from the year earlier and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $ 332 million . And we recognized the remaining $ 43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement . Let 's start with our Gaming platform . Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $ 1.03 billion , up 49 % year-on-year . Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs , including gaming notebooks .

We are excited to be working with Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system . Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform . Moving to Professional Visualization . Quadro revenue grew to $ 205 million , up 8 % from a year ago , amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstation . We 're seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs . Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy 's most advanced ships . The Marines utilize VR to train aircrew personnel .

We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problem of autonomous driving . Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just 1 year ago , more than 225 car and truck makers , suppliers , research organizations and start-ups have begun developing with it . That number has grown by more than 50 % in the past quarter alone , the result of the platform 's enhanced processing power and the introduction of TensorRT for the in-vehicle AI inferencing . This quarter , we announced 2 important partnerships : Bosch , world 's largest auto supplier , which does business all over the world , carmakers is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform ; and Paccar , one of the world 's largest truck makers , is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt , Kenworth and DAF", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2017-May-09", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-May-09-NVDA.txt"}}

So our GPU computing business for Datacenter is growing very fast and it 's growing on multiple dimensions . On the one hand , there 's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods . We call that HPC . That 's growing . There is , in enterprise , the virtualization of graphics . There 's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around . However , more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows . And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center . It 's easier to manage . The total cost of ownership is lower , and mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be . And so the second pillar of that is called GRID and it 's basically virtualizing the PC . And as you can tell , virtualization , mobility , better security , those are all driving forces there .

The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial , and that 's why they 're in such great demand . And it 's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them , so that they can be productive .

And so that one -- that first pillar is the market that we -- is a segment of the ... ( technical difficulty ) or gets strained , once the network is trained , it is put into production .

And the NVIDIA GeForce GPU , the PC gaming card is , on average , far less . There are people who just absolutely demand the best . And the reason for that is because they 're driving a monitor or they 're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond the TV .

And last time I checked , there 's many , many , tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials . And so I 'm looking forward to letting people try it .

And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between 1 to 2 . And some of them are just learning about it . And almost no companies today use AI in a large way . So on the one hand , we know now that the technology is of extreme value . And we under -- we 're getting a better understanding of how to apply it . On the other hand , no industry uses it at the moment . The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it . The manufacturing industry will be . Everything in transport will be . Retail , Etail everything will be . And so I think the impact is going to be large and we just -- we 're just getting started . We 're just getting started .

I think there 's a couple of ways to think about it . First of all , we know that this is the -- we know that some -- the world causes the end of Moore 's Law , but it 's really the end of 2 dynamics that has happened . And one dynamic , of course , is the end of processor architecture productive innovation , okay , end of instruction-level parallelism advances . The second is the end of Dennard scaling . And the combination of those 2 things makes it look like it 's the end of Moore 's Law . The easy way to think about that is -- the easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely -- if we want to advance computing performance , we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone . That 's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors . We want the best transistors . There 's no question about it . But we do n't need it to advance .

We tune it across the top , from the top to bottom , all the way from bottom to top . And so as a result , transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use . And like I said , it 's really , really important to us and I want the best . And TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get . And we push along with them as hard as we can .

And so we have a team working with the health care industry . We have a team that 's working with the Internet service providers . We have a team that 's working with the manufacturing industry . We have a team that 's working with the financial services industry . We have a team that 's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise , so -- with the automotive industry . And so we have different verticals . We call them verticals and we have teams of business development people , developer relations , computational mathematicians that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform . And so it starts with developing a platform stack . Of course , one of the most famous examples of that is our Gaming business . It 's just another vertical for us . And it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce and then it has its own ecosystem of partners . And so that 's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems . And then the second thing that we do is we have , horizontally , partner management teams that work with our partners , the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners so that we could help them succeed .", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2017-May-09", "chunk_index": 47, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-May-09-NVDA.txt"}}

Supercomputing to us is a collection of -- not a collection but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world . And some of the famous ones , whether it 's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC , you 've got TiTech in Japan , there are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputer centers or open science . And so we consider those supercomputing centers . High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to , well , to simulate something . It could be scenarios for predicting equity , or , for example , as you guys know , Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing center -- or high-performance computing centers .

There 's cloud service provision , which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have been -- that has adopted CUDA over the years .

And in the case of Google , they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC . And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs . And so I published a blog . I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons and you could look that up .

It 's -- there are 10 million CPUs in the world in a cloud , and today , many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that . But in the future , the belief is that the vast majority of the world 's cloud queries will be inference queries , will be AI queries . Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes . And I think that 's our opportunity . We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world and it 's up to us to prove it . At the moment , I think it 's safe to say that the P40 , the Tesla P40 , is the fastest on the planet , period .

Moving to data center . Revenue was $ 655 million , down 14 % year-on-year and up 3 % sequentially . In the vertical industries portion of the business , expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth . In hyperscale portion , we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CPU -- CSPs . Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid . While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted , the engineering focus on AI is growing . Let me give some color on each of these areas .

For example , in retail , Walmart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models , slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs . By accelerating its data science workflow , Walmart can improve its algorithms , reduce development cycles and test new features . Earlier this week , we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT , or Bidirectional Encoder Representations of -- from Transformers , a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language , context and meaning . This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box , intelligent personal assistants and search engines . We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances . AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA . Last month , we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks , particularly in the most demanding areas . In just 7 months , we have achieved up to 80 % speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware .

All in , our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong . In setting these MLPerf records , we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer , demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure . This system debuted in June at # 22 on the TOP500 list of the world 's fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference . Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program , it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects . We 've made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers , essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months . It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems , which are built from thousands of servers . Also at the conference , we announced that by next year 's end , we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA 's full stack of AI and HPC software , which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks .

Revenue reached $ 291 million , up 4 % from our prior year and up 9 % sequentially . Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors . We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH , the computer graphics industry 's biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles . Our researchers won several Best in Show awards . In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing , over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors , including Adobe , Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others . NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering , augmented reality and virtual reality .

The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport , recycling collection , public transport , construction , mining , forestry and more . This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle , not just cars but also trucks , shuttles , business , taxis and many others , will have autonomous capability 1 day . Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry , in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world 's transport systems . Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks , which can operate 24 hours a day . To help address these needs , NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing .

Yes , thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that , over time , we 'll continue to see our overall volumes improve . Essentially , our business is normalized . We 've reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters .

And my expectation is that it 's going to grow a lot more , and let me explain to you why . Aside from a couple -- a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers , the overall trend , the broad-based trend , of our data center business is upward , to the right . And it is growing very nicely . There 's a couple of different dynamics that 's causing that on first principles to grow . And of course , one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing , our computing architecture is really ideal for it . AI is not just one network . It 's thousands of different types of networks , and these networks are getting more and more complex over time , the amount of data you have to process is enormous .

And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we 've created is really the ideal architecture . We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time . The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary . And the applications of AI , as you guys are watching yourself , are just spreading in every single industry . And so the way we think about AI is in waves , if you will . The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture , and that was the first part where -- that 's when a lot of people discovered who we are , and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI . The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers . They have a large amount of data . They have a lot of consumer applications . Many of them are not life-critical and so , therefore , the application of an early technology -- early-adoption technology was really viable . And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI .

Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions . Instead of having a page of -- a list of options , it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one . The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI . And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally , but they 're using AI to create new products and services . They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health . It could be something related to an application that -- used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection . It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you , delivery bots . And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence , for the very first time , you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you 're putting all over the world . And that 's the next phase of growth . And it affects companies from large industrials , transportation companies , retailers , you name it . Health care companies , you name it .

And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware , it 's going to be super well positioned for -- throughout all of next year . Your question about APIs and software programmability . APIs is just one of the issues . The large issue about processors is how do you program it . The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers : how to program a computer . And how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science , and it 's an area of tremendous research . Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge . Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge . And yet , when we created CUDA in our GPUs , we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now , in the case of large-scale systems , millions of processor cores . And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU , multi-node ? It 's a concept that 's not easy to grasp . And so I do n't really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together . And I ca n't make it fit in my head .

Thanks , Joe . Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts . The first part is a full stack , which is building the architected processor , the system , the system software and all of the driving applications on top , including the deep neural nets . The second part of it , we call that a full stack self-driving car computer . The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system . For those who would like to use our processors , use our system software but create their own applications , we created a system that allows -- basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-Aug-15", "chunk_index": 42, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Aug-15-NVDA.txt"}}

And the 2 systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay . And then the third part of our business model is development agreements , otherwise known as NRE . These 3 elements , full stack computer , end-to-end development flow and NRE project development -- product development consists of the overall DRIVE business . And so although the cars will take several years to go into production , we 're seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects . And so we 're -- the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine . And so my sense is that we 're going to continue to do well here . The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles , self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses . Those kind of autonomous machines require basically the same technology , but it 's sooner and easier to deploy .

But if we did that for Turing , the adoption rate is actually faster . And to me , it 's a rather sensible . And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12 . And Maxwell was DX12 .

We 're mentioning it more and more because it 's such an exciting book market for us is notebooks . The install base of Pascal has a very , very little notebook in it . And the reason for that is because , in the past , we were never able to put a high performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q . And in combination with our energy efficiency , we were able to -- we 're now able to put a 2080 into a laptop , and it 's still beautiful . And so this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us . And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop , I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us .

Vertical industry growth was driven primarily by consumer Internet companies . Other verticals such as retail , health care and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements , and we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing , data science and edge computing applications . T4 , our inference platform , had another strong quarter , with shipments up 4x year-on-year , driven by public cloud deployments as well as edge AI video analytics applications . T4 and V100 , reflecting strong demand for inference and training , respectfully , set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue . Even as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training , NVIDIA 's inference platform is getting wide use by some of the world 's leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies , including American Express , Microsoft , PayPal , Pinterest , Snap and Twitter . The industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA . For example , Microsoft 's biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference of its natural language understanding models . These DNN transformer models popularized by BERT have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models .

Conversational AI is a major new workload , requiring GPUs for inference to achieve high throughput within the desired low latency . Indeed , Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs , enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide . And just this week , Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2 . This advances the state of the art for AI assistance in tasks , such as answering questions , summarization and natural language generation . Recommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet , powering billions of queries per second . The industry is moving to deep recommendators such as wide and deep model , which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content . Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs . For example , Alibaba 's and Baidu 's recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI , boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitudes beyond CPUs . Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10 % increase in click-through rates . We also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure .

Toshiya , thanks a lot for your question . The primary driver for our growth is AI . There are 4 fundamental dynamics . The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs , in fact , in natural language understanding , in conversational AI , in recommendation systems . And you know this , but for the others in the audience , recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today . And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world , whether it 's a store or whether it 's content or websites or information you are querying , there are hundreds of billions , trillions , and depending on how you count it , hundreds of trillions of items in", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Feb-13", "chunk_index": 14, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Feb-13-NVDA.txt"}}

And there are billions of people , each with their own characteristics and their countless contexts . And between the items , the people , the users and the various contexts that we 're in , location and what you 're looking for and weather or what 's happening in the environment , those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you . The recommendation system is just foundational now to search . And some people have said this is the end of search and the beginning -- and the era of recommendation systems . Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems . And very first time over the last year , it 's been able to be done in deep learning . And so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI . The second is production AI , which means that whereas we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the models are getting larger , and there are more of them , we 're seeing a lot of these models going into production , and that business is called inference . Inference , as Colette mentioned , grew 4x year-over-year . It 's a substantial part of our business now . But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7 , the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000 , a doubling over a year ago", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Feb-13", "chunk_index": 15, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Feb-13-NVDA.txt"}}

What most people do n't understand about inference is it 's an incredibly complex computational problem , but it 's an enormously complex software problem . And so the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called inference . The third is the growth , not just in hyperscale anymore , but in public cloud and in vertical industries . Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud . And the OpEx model works much better for them as they 're younger . When they become larger , they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem , but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud . We 're also seeing really great success in verticals . One of the most exciting vertical is logistics . Logistics , retail , warehousing . We announced , I think , this quarter or last -- end of last quarter , USPS , American Express , Walmart , just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they 're trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on . And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries . And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot , and this is really , really exciting , and it 's called edge AI .", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Feb-13", "chunk_index": 16, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Feb-13-NVDA.txt"}}

And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot , and this is really , really exciting , and it 's called edge AI . We used to call it industries and AI where the action is . But the industry now calls edge AI . We 're seeing a lot of excitement there . And the reason for that is you need to have low latency inference . You might not be able to stream the data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons , and you need the response time . And so those 4 dynamics around AI really drove our growth . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 4 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Joseph Lawrence Moore , Morgan Stanley , Research Division - Executive Director [ 5 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Feb-13", "chunk_index": 17, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Feb-13-NVDA.txt"}}

Just following up on that . As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business , now that you have the perspective of seeing what 's driving the rebound , any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place ? Was it just digestion ? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about ? Just help us -- what happened there ?

And all of that happened this last year . And as a result , we had record sales of V100s and T4s .

Aaron , I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday . And at the very core of it , most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it . Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities , filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries . Whether it 's shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question , the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down . And that filtering process is called recommendation . That recommendation system is really complex , and deep learning is going to be involved in all that . That 's the first thing . I believe that every query will be accelerated .

I believe that every query will be accelerated . The second is , as you know , CPU scaling has really slowed , and there 's just no two ways about it . It 's not a marketing thing . It 's a physics thing . And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended . And it 's called the end of Dennard scaling . And so there has to be another approach . The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that 's necessary to -- for every single query but the benefit that comes along with that , and the end of Dennard scaling , suggests that there needs to be another approach , and we believe that approach is acceleration . Now our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator . Notice , we never say accelerator , we say accelerated computing . And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs . The AIs will continue to evolve , the models will continue to evolve and get larger , and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable .

The $ 100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or may be overall demand . But we 're still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be .

The sell-through is fantastic all over the world .

It 's more seasonal because devices , systems , like notebooks and Switch , are built largely in 2 quarters , Q2 and Q3 . And they build it largely in Q2 and Q3 because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world . And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season .

It was n't until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary . And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed .

Eventually , if -- the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems , these require instantaneous response . The faster the answer , the more likely someone is going to click on the answer . And so you know that latency matters a great deal , and it 's measurable . The effect on the business is directly measurable . And so for conversational AI , for example , we 've been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to , for example , fix the errors and such , come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis . That entire pipeline could take several seconds . We run it so fast that it 's possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of hundred , 200 , 300 milliseconds . That is in the realm of interactive conversation . Beyond that , it 's just simply too slow . And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference , moving to production . And then secondarily , conversational AI and latency-sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential , now moving forward , I think you 're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference . The way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling . Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way .

And I think as I mentioned , I think I mentioned earlier to another question , I believe that in the future , the data center will all be accelerated . It will be all running AI models , and it will be software-defined and it will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential . As you move out to the edge , it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined , whether it has to be programmable or whether it 's fix functioned . There are many , many devices where the inference work is very specific . It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion . Those type of inference models are -- could still be based on deep learning . It 's function-specific . You do n't have to change it very often and you 're running 1 or 2 models at any given point in time . And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective . I believe , those AI chips , you 're going to have AI chips that are $ 0.50 , $ 1 , and you 're just going to put it into something and it 's going to be doing magical detections .

Revenue reached a record in the third quarter exceeding $ 2 billion for the first time . Driving this was success in our Pascal-based gaming platform and growth in our data center platform reflecting the role of NVIDIA 's GPU as the engine of AI computing . Q3 revenue increased 54 % from a year earlier to $ 2 billion and was up 40 % from the previous quarter . Strong year-on-year gains were achieved across all four of our platforms . Gaming , professional visualization , data center , and automotive . The GPU business was up 53 % to $ 1.7 billion , and the Tegra processor business increased 87 % to $ 241 million . Let 's start with our gaming platform . Gaming revenue crossed the $ 1 billion mark and increased 63 % year on year to a record $ 1.24 billion fueled by our Pascal-based GPUs . Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop and notebook and across the full gaming audience from GTX 1050 to the Titan X. GeForce gaming PC notebooks recorded significant gains . Our continued growth in the GTX gaming GPUs reflects the unprecedented performance and efficiency gains in the Pascal architecture . It delivers seamless play on games and richly immersive VR experiences . In Q3 for desktops , we launched the GTX 1050 and the 1050 Ti bringing eSports and VR capabilities at great value .

We have also been developing a cloud-to-car HD mapping system with mapping companies all over the world . Two such partnerships were announced this quarter . We are working with Baidu to create a cloud-to-car development platform with HD maps , Level 3 autonomous vehicles , and automated parking . We are also partnering with TomTom to develop an AI-based , cloud-to-car mapping system that enables real-time , in-car localization to mapping . We 've developed an integrated , scalable AI platform with capabilities ranging from automated highway driving to fully autonomous driving operation . We are extending the DRIVE PX2 architecture to scale in performance and power consumption . It will range from DRIVE PX2 auto cruise with a single SSE for self-driving on highways up to multiple DRIVE PX2 computers capable of enabling fully autonomous driving . We also announced a single-chip AI supercomputer called Xavier with over 7 billion transistors . Xavier incorporates our next GPU architecture , a custom CPU design , and a new computer vision accelerator . Xavier will deliver performance equivalent to today 's full DRIVE PX2 board , and its two Parker SoCs and two Pascal GPUs while only consuming a fraction of the energy .

Beyond our four platforms , our OEM and IP business was $ 186 million , down 4 % year on year . Now , turning to the rest of the income statement . GAAP gross margin for Q3 was a record 59 % , and non-GAAP gross margin was a record 59.2 % . These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs , the success of our platform approach , and strong demand for Deep Learning . GAAP operating expenses were $ 544 million including $ 66 million in stock-based compensation and other charges . Non-GAAP operating expenses were $ 478 million , up 11 % from one year earlier . This reflects headcount-related costs for our growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing . We intend to continue to invest in Deep Learning to capture this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . Thus , we would expect the operating expense growth rate to be sustained over the next several quarters . GAAP operating income was $ 639 million .

First of all , GPU computing is more important than ever . There 's so many different types of applications that require GPU computing today , and it 's permeating all over enterprise . There are several applications that we 're really driving . One of them is graphics virtualization , application virtualization . Partnering with VMware and Citrix , we have essentially taken very compute-intensive , very graphics-intensive applications , virtualizing it and putting it into the data center . The second is computational sciences . Using our GPU for general-purpose scientific computing , and scientific computing , as you know , is not just for scientists . It 's running equations and using numerics is a tool that is important to a large number of industries . And then , third , one of the most exciting things that we 're doing because of deep learning we 've really ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world . These several applications -- graphics application , virtualization , computational science , and data science has really driven our opportunity in the data center . The thing that made it possible though -- the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation from our Company from a graphics processor to a general-purpose processor", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Nov-10", "chunk_index": 11, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Nov-10-NVDA.txt"}}

What makes application and graphics virtualization possible is a complicated stack of software we call GRID , and you have heard me talk about it for several years now . And , second , in the area of numerics and computational sciences , CUDA , our rich library of applications and libraries on top of numerics -- numerical libraries on top of CUDA and all the tools that we have invested in the ecosystem we have worked with all the developers all around the world that now know how to use CUDA to develop applications makes that part of our business possible . And then , third , our deep learning toolkit , the NVIDIA deep learning toolkit has made it possible for all frameworks in the world to get GPU acceleration . And , with GPU acceleration the benefit is incredible . It 's not 20 % it 's not 50 % . It 's 20 times , 50 times . That translates to most importantly for researchers the ability to gain access to insight much , much faster . Instead of months , it could be days . It 's essentially like having a time machine .

We had one in Australia , and also one in India and Washington DC and Amsterdam for Europe . So , we pretty much covered the world with our first global developer conference . I would say probably the two themes that came out of it , is that GPU acceleration , the GPU has really reached a tipping point . That it is so available everywhere . It 's available on PCs . It 's available from every computer company in the world . It 's in the cloud . It 's in the data center . It 's in laptops . GPU is no longer a niche component .

And , we had an install base of some 60 million , 80 million gamers during that time and several years have now gone by . The question is what would be the upgrade cycle for Pascal , and what would it look like ? There are several things that have changed that I think it 's important to know that could affect the Pascal upgrade . First of all , the increase in adoption , the number of units has grown , and the number of the ASP has grown . And , I think the reason for that is several-fold . I think , one , the number of gamers in the world is growing . Everybody that is effectively born in the last 10 , 15 years are likely to be a gamer and so long as they have access to electricity and the Internet , they are very likely a gamer . The quality of games has grown significantly . One of the factors of production value of games that has been possible is because the PC and the two game consoles , Xbox and PlayStation , and in the future , in the near future , the Nintendo Switch . All of these architectures are common in the sense that they all use modern GPUs . They all use programmable shading , and they all have basically similar features . They have very different design points . They have different capabilities , but they have very similar architectural features .

As a result of that , game developers can target a much larger install base with one common code base . As a result , they can increase the production quality , the production value of the games . The second -- and one of the things that you might have noticed that recently , PlayStation and Xbox both announced 4K versions . Basically , the Pro versions of their game console . That 's really exciting for the gaming industry . It 's really exciting for us because what 's going to happen is the production value of games will amp up , and as a result , it would increase the adoption of higher-end GPUs . I think that that 's a very important positive . That 's probably the second one . The first one being the number of gamers is growing . Second is game production value continues to grow . And then the third is gaming is no longer just about gaming . Gaming is part sports , part gaming , and part social . There 's a lot of people who play games just so they can hang out with their other friends who are playing games . It 's a social phenomenon .

Because there are so many people in gaming , because it 's a fun thing to do , and it 's hard to do so it 's hard to master . And the size of the industry is large . It has become a real sporting event . And , one of the things that I 'll predict is that one of these days , I believe that gaming would likely be the world 's largest sport industry . And , the reason for that is because it 's the largest industry . There are more people who play games and now enjoy games and watch other people play games than there are people who play football , for example . So , I think it stands to reason that eSports will be the largest sporting industry in the world , and that 's just a matter of time before it happens . So , I think all of these factors have been driving both the increase in the size of the market for us as well as the ASP of the GPUs for us . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Nov-10", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Nov-10-NVDA.txt"}}

How do you put something in the cloud that have no GPUs , and how do you GPU-accelerate these applications that are increasingly GPU-accelerated ? The answer is , of course , is putting GPUs in the cloud and putting GPUs in data center . That 's what GRID is all about . It 's about virtualization . It 's about putting GPUs in large-scale data centers and be able to virtualize the applications so that we can enjoy it on any computer , on any device , and putting computing closer to the data . I think we 're just in the beginning of that , and that could explain why GRID is finally after a long period of time of building the ecosystem , building the infrastructure , developing all the software , getting the quality of service to be really exquisite , working with the ecosystem partners , it has really taken off .

Not 20 % more performance but 10 times better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs . I think that 's a well-known fact . Our strategy is very different than any of that . Our strategy is really about building a computing platform . Our GPU is not a specific function thing anymore . It 's a general-purpose parallel processor . CUDA can do molecular dynamics . It could do fluid dynamics . It could do partial differential equations . It could do linear algebra .

I think , as you have heard me say this before , I think that training is a new set of HPC clusters that have been added into these data centers . And then , the next thing that 's going to happen is you 're going to see GPUs being added to a lot of these 5 million to 10 million nodes so that you could accelerate every single query that will likely come into the data center will be an AI query in the future .

Congratulations on the solid execution and growth . Looking at some of your cloud customers ' new services offerings , you mentioned AWS EC2 P2 platform . You have Microsoft Azure 's Cloud Services platforms . It 's interesting because they are ramping new instances primarily using your K80 accelerator platform which means that the Maxwell base and the recently introduced Pascal-based adoption curves are still way ahead of the team which obviously is a great setup as it relates to the continued strong growth going forward . Can you just help us understand why the long design and cycle times for these accelerators ? And , when do you expect the adoption curve for the Maxwell-based accelerators to start to kick in with some of your Cloud customers ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Nov-10", "chunk_index": 41, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Nov-10-NVDA.txt"}}

And , it 's exactly the reason why having started almost five years ago in working with all of these large-scale data centers is what it takes . The reason for that is because several things have to happen . Applications have to be developed . They 're hyperscale . They are enterprise -- their data center-level software has to accommodate this new computing platform . The neural networks have to be developed and trained and ready for deployment . The GPUs have to be tested against every single data center and every single server configuration that they have , and it takes that type of time to deploy at the scales that we are talking about . So , I think that , that 's number one . The good news is that between Kepler and Maxwell and Pascal , the architecture is identical .

And so , the number one is autonomous driving , autonomous vehicles is an AI computing problem . It 's not a detection problem . Second , car companies realize that they need to deliver ultimately a service . That the service is a network of cars by which they continuously improve . It 's like phones . It 's like set-top boxes . You have to maintain and serve that customer because they are interested in the service of autonomous driving . It 's not a functionality . Autonomous driving is always being improved with better maps and better driving behavior and better perception capability and better AI , so the software component of it and the ability for car companies to own their own software once they develop it on our platform is a real positive . Real positive to the point where it 's enabling , or it 's essential for the future of the driving fleets . And then , the third -- to be able to continue to do OTA on them . And , third , is simply the performance and energy level .

One of the things that I wonder as maybe AI and deep learning acceleration standardize on your platform , what you are seeing and hearing in the Valley about startup activity ?

From a reporting segment perspective , Q2 GPU revenue increased 59 % to $ 1.9 billion from a year earlier . Tegra Processor revenue doubled to $ 333 million . OEM revenue reached $ 251 million , reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs , partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel . Let 's start with our Gaming platform . Gaming revenue was $ 1.19 billion , up 52 % year-on-year and up 15 % from Q1 . This reflects the vibrant Gaming ecosystem underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launched GPUs and other technologies , great games and growing interest in eSports . Gamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs , with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 Series products . Our new Max-Q design approach enabling Gaming notebooks that are thinner , lighter and faster is finding a strong market . Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs . Quality games continue to drive GPU sales . At the E3 Gaming expo in L.A. , we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running on 4K on PCs , which drew rave reviews . Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty , World War II , Star Wars : Battlefront 2 and Middle-earth : Shadow of War . We 're also seeing the rise of independent titles that will become runaway hits , most notably , a new last-man-standing shooter called PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds . Gaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of eSports .

The $ 24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf 's richest event , the US Open . For the third straight year , GeForce GTX is Dota 2 's official graphics platform . GPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity , or Ethereum . We served a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board , as seen in our OEM sales , and some with GeForce GTX boards . Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market , knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies . Moving to professional visualization . Quadro revenue grew $ 235 million , up 10 % from a year ago , up 15 % sequentially and a demand for high-end , real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations . Demand was especially strong in education , both among universities and large public school districts , as well as in the financial sector and defense industry . And last week , at SIGGRAPH 's computer graphics show , we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation . This new Optix 5 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing .

Next , Datacenter . Revenue of $ 416 million was up more than 2.5x from a year ago . This growth , shared across AI , deep learning , high-performance computing and GRID , is particularly notable given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal-generation GPUs . Looking ahead , we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs . V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter 's GPU Technology Conference . It provides 10x the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor , widely outpacing Moore 's Law . Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the [ CBPR ] and ICML conferences . We made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning applications . It delivers 100x faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation . And it supports the industry 's 2 most common AI frameworks : Google TensorFlow and Facebook 's Caffe . We also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI .

Volkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization , and we announced a new partner program with Taiwan 's top ODMs including Foxconn , Inventec , Quanta , Wistron to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture , GPU computing technology and design guidelines . Demand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications . Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs . We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers , with 1,000 plus in the pipeline . Our HTC business remained strong . The new Green500 list showed that the world 's 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators . The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology 's TSUBAME 3.0 system . It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt , 50 % higher efficiency than the previous leader , helping to point the way to [ exascale ] supercomputing . Momentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business . Among key wins was Amazon Web Services whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs . In automotive .

On the clarification side , we have seen several quarters where your Datacenter business grew very strongly on a sequential basis . This time , the growth was somewhat more modest , and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that . And then the bigger question is , Jensen , it seems the data center market is sort of bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side .

I thought we did great . I thought we did great . We almost tripled year-over-year . And we ramped Volta into volume production . And because Volta was so much better than our last-generation processor , Volta is 100x faster than Kepler . 100x faster than Kepler just 4 years ago , and Kepler was already 10x faster than CPUs . And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter . I thought the team did fantastically , transitioning the customer base to Volta , and now Volta is in high-volume production . The application of data center -- you asked a larger question about data center . The data center , data center is a very large market , as you know , and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world 's future computing will be largely done in data centers . And there 's a very well-accepted notion now that GPU acceleration for servers delivers extraordinary value proposition . If you have a data-intensive application and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data-intensive , a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the number of the amount of throughput pretty substantially .

Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in the number of servers . And so the value proposition in the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary . There are several applications in data centers . First of all , there 's training and there 's high-performance computing ; there 's cloud virtual PC , as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this last -- this quarter ; and then there 's also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production and the new applications that are coming online , which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future , which is live video . Consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing with their friends and there 's -- there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time . And each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be -- you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences . And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable , from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI , are starting to emerge .

The one area where you 're talking about ASICs and TPUs , TPU is basically an ASIC . The way to think about that is this is after 4 generations of evolution of our GPU , NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more . We could perform deep learning applications , whether it 's in training or in inferencing now , starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation . We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I 've ever seen . And so the new generation of our GPU is essentially a TPU that does a lot more , and we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud . And so our belief is this . Our belief is that , number one , a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud , because the cloud is a computer , it 's not an appliance . It 's not a toaster , it 's not a lightbulb , it 's not a microphone . The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive . And second , we have to be world-class at deep learning .

But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas . We shipped a lot of Voltas . And Volta is fully ramped . Customers are clamoring for it .

Whenever you include a Volta in your data center , in your server that is doing data-intensive processing , the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary . Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars . And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that , of course , the manufacturing process is quite extraordinary . I mean , these are expensive things to go and design . The manufacturing cost itself , you guys can estimate , is probably in the several hundred dollars , close to $ 1,000 . However , the software intensity of developing Volta , the architectural intensity of developing Volta , the -- all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value added ultimately ends up . And so I guess , the pricing -- your question really is pricing , we 're going to -- we expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta . And then your second question , I think , is related to acceleration . The growth -- the data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant , as you know .

I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever . And so our -- I think # 1 is our strategic position . The second , if the demand were there in the second half with respect to -- from a perspective of Gaming demand , and if there 's any residual with crypto demand , we will surely be able to serve it .

And when we look at the charts that you 've published about your expectation for exaflops -- the number of exaflops required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020 , it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time .

I think , at the highest level , the way to think about that is data-intensive computing . Data-intensive computing , whether it 's deep learning or high-performance computing , the GPU is just phenomenal at it . NVIDIA 's CUDA GPU was after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach , it 's just a home run . And the value proposition and the money that it saves people , the amount of energy that it saves , is quite extraordinary . One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10 , you 're basically saying that it takes 10x fewer servers to do the same job or you could do 10x as much work in the same amount of servers .

Q3 revenue was $ 3.01 billion , down 5 % year-on-year and up 17 % sequentially . Starting with our gaming business . Revenue of $ 1.66 billion was down 6 % year-on-year and up 26 % sequentially . Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming . Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics . While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago , 2 dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way . Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers , including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft , Call of Duty , Battlefield , Watch Dogs , Tomb Raider , Doom , Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk . Of note , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare , had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on heels of CONTROL , an action-adventure game with multiple ray trace features . Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance .

RTX GPUs now drive more than 2/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue . Gaming laptops were a standout , driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth . This holiday season , our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers , students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market . This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology , triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year . In late October , we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super , which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance , faster memory and new features . The 1660 Super delivers 50 % more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060 , the best-selling gaming GPU of all time . It began shipping on October 29 , priced at just $ 229 . PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming . We also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models , Shield TV and Shield TV Pro , which launched on October 28 . These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks .

Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year , and we believe our visibility is improving . Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI , the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue , capturing context and providing intelligent responses . Google 's breakthrough , introduction of the BERT model , with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding , is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding . That , in turn , is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts . First , these models are massive and highly complex . They have 10 to 20x , in some cases 100x , more parameters than image-based models . As a result , training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that , in orders of magnitude , beyond what is needed in the past . Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here . Second , real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition , language understanding , text-to-speech and voice encoding .

Second , real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition , language understanding , text-to-speech and voice encoding . While conventional approaches fail at these tasks , NVIDIA 's GPUs can handle the entire inference chain , in less than 30 milliseconds . This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration . Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference . In addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity , our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds . In September , Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally , following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year . We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs , and both were records . Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue . Last week , the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference , MLPerf inference , were announced . We won . In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications , NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks . This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads , which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us .

Additionally , we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing . This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores , warehouses , manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure . Finally , last week , we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington , D.C. , which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers , CIOs and federal employees . At the event , we announced that the U.S .

We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities . Over 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs . Just last week , at the Adobe Max Conference , RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps . RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers , driving demand for our RTX GPUs . We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science , AI and VR applications . Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing , public sector , higher education and health care customers . Finally , turning to automotive . Revenue was $ 162 million , down 6 % from a year ago and down 22 % sequentially . The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2 . Additionally , we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness . Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles .

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1 % and 64.5 % , respectively , plus or minus 50 basis points . GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $ 1.02 billion and $ 805 million , respectively . GAAP and non-GAAP OI & E are both expected to be income of approximately $ 25 million . GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9 % , plus or minus 1 % , excluding discrete items . Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 130 million to $ 150 million . Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website . In closing , let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community . We will be at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3 , Deutsche Bank 's Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology , Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11 .

Thanks a lot , Vivek . We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers . As Colette mentioned earlier , we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s . And for the very first time , we shipped more T4s than V100 . And most of the T4s are driven by inference . In fact , our inference business is now a solid double-digit , and it doubled year-over-year . And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors . The -- as you know , we 've been working on deep learning for some time , and people have been developing deep learning models . It started with computer vision .

But image recognition does n't really take that much of the data center capacity . Over the last couple of years , a couple of very important developments have happened . One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems . As you know , recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet . Whenever you do shopping , whenever you 're watching movies , looking at news , doing search , all of the personalized web pages , all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections . All of that is vitally important . For the very first time , we 're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world . And so increasingly , you 're going to see people roll this out . And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning . The second part is conversational AI . Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces ; at first , speech recognition , which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming . Then you go into speech recognition . Then it goes to natural language understanding , which then gets connected to a recommendation system , which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder . And then that has to be done very , very quickly . Whereas images could be done", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-Nov-14", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Nov-14-NVDA.txt"}}

And then that has to be done very , very quickly . Whereas images could be done off-line , conversation has to be done in real time . And without acceleration and without NVIDIA 's accelerators , it 's really not possible to do it in real time . It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models , and now we 're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time . And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders , the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer , that breakthrough is really quite significant . And since then , derivative works have come from that approach . And natural language understanding is really , really working incredibly well . And so what we 're seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world , we work with just about everybody , this area of work is really complicated . The models are very , very large . There 's a whole bunch of models that has to work together , and they 're getting larger . And so that 's one large category , which is the hyperscalers . The second , which we introduced this quarter , is really about taking AI out to the edge . And the reason for that is because there are many applications , whether it 's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there 's a vibration sensor", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-Nov-14", "chunk_index": 14, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Nov-14-NVDA.txt"}}

There 's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment , monitor the conditions of various situations . And you want to do the processing at the point of action . This way , you do n't have to screen the data , which is continuous back into the cloud , which costs a lot of money . You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters . Maybe you 're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot . And then lastly , one major issue is data sovereignty . Maybe your company does n't own all of the data that you are processing and , therefore , you have to do that processing at the edge , and you ca n't afford to put that into the cloud . And so these various industries : retail , warehouse , logistics , smart cities , we 're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that . And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX , which basically is a cloud native , completely secure , takes advantage of NVIDIA 's full stack of every single model .

BMW is using it for logistics , Procter & Gamble for manufacturing , Samsung Electronics for manufacturing , visual inspection . And then last week , we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world , the United States Postal Service . And so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons . If you just kind of estimated the size of retail , it 's nearly $ 30 trillion . And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient , it could save the industry a lot of money : warehouses , logistics , transportation , farming . I think there 's like 0.5 million farms in the world , covers 1/3 of the world 's land mass . And so there 's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference .

The -- during Q3 -- during Q4 and Q1 , we see normal seasonal declines of console builds , and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds . And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4 . And so we 're seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems . Overall , for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic . Let me tell you why it 's so important . I would say that at this point , I think it 's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run . Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing . Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles . The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling , it 's not possible to really go back anymore . And so I think that it 's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future . And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that do n't have the benefits of it , and I 'm looking forward to upgrading them .

And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform , new gaming platform that emerges . And we 're just in the beginning innings of that . And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting , and it 's going to drive our continued growth for some time .

C.J. , that 's really good . Let me break it down . So when we think about hyperscale , there are 3 parts : training , inference and public cloud . Training , you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they 've been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models . These large models are now only getting larger . The amount of data necessary , therefore , has to scale as well . The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months . And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding . And all of a sudden , a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved . And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work , now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding . This is , of course , a much , much harder problem . And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously . I think what we 're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing , training . The second part is an untapped", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-Nov-14", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Nov-14-NVDA.txt"}}

The second part is an untapped market for us , and this untapped market is really inference .

The models are very large . They 're very diverse . They require large amount of computation , large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability . And so I 've talked about this before , but I 've never been able to validate it . And of course , with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and , frankly , only -- the only one although so many have attempted , they submitted results and some of them resented it , that this benchmark is just really , really hard . Inference is hard . And then finally , our business results also validated the -- our intuition . And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global . We 're working across natural language understanding , recommendation systems , conversational AI , just a whole bunch of really , really interesting problems . Now the cloud is the third piece .

I think we 're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world . In health care , in transportation , in retail , in consumer Internet , in Fintech , the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary . I think over the last 3 or 4 , 5 years , some $ 20 billion , $ 30 billion have been invested into start-ups . And these start-ups , of course , use cloud service providers so that they do n't have to invest in their own infrastructure because it 's fairly complicated . And so we 're seeing a lot of growth there . And so that 's just the hyperscalers . The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth -- 3 areas of growth : training , inference and public cloud . And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups . Then there 's the intelligent edge , which we recently ventured into , and we 've been building this platform called EGX for some time . And it 's cloud native . It 's incredibly secure . You can manage it from afar . It 's -- the stack is complicated . It 's performant .

And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance , the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center . The power of putting it into data center , as you know , is flexibility and fungibility . With the low latency capability of 5G , you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub . And depending on where the traffic is going , you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center , something that you ca n't do in basebands , in baseband units in the cell towers , but you can do that in the data center . And that helps them reduce the cost . The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center 's computation at the edge . And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it 's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they 're geographically located and is distributed all over the world .

As you know , we lowered our fourth quarter guidance on January 28 , and our results are in line with our pre-announcement . Q4 revenue was $ 2.21 billion , down 24 % from a year earlier , driven primarily by a 45 % year-on-year decline in gaming . Full year revenue was $ 11.72 billion , up 21 % from our previous year . Starting with our gaming business . Revenue of $ 954 million was down 45 % year-on-year and down 46 % sequentially , weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter . Full year revenue was up 13 % to $ 6.25 billion . Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline .

Full year revenue was up 13 % to $ 6.25 billion . Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline . First , post-crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through . We expect channel inventories to normalize in Q1 , in line with 1- to 2-quarter time line we had outlined on our previous earnings call . Second , deteriorating macroeconomic conditions , particularly in China , impacted consumer demand for our GPUs . And third , sales of certain high-end GPUs using our new Turing architecture , including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070 , were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture . These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real-time ray tracing and AI , but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for new -- for lower price points or further demonstration of the RTX technology in actual games . The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model . Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line . Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the normalized business looks like .

To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year , it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across a period that does n't include crypto demand . Let 's look at the 4 quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 this year . In Q2 and Q3 of last year , with the benefit of hindsight , we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be . To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory , we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4 , and will do so again in Q1 . Therefore , exiting Q1 , we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels . On average , our desktop gaming revenue across these 4 quarters is about $ 900 million . We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period . Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $ 500 million per quarter over the same 4 quarters . Thus , in total , we believe our normalized quarterly gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $ 1.4 billion . As we look past Q1 , we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed . On a full year basis , we expect our gaming business to be down slightly , given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming .

On a full year basis , we expect our gaming business to be down slightly , given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming . At CES last month , we launched into the recovery of our gaming business . We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the midrange price point of $ 349 . The 2060 delivers a 60 % performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing 's real-time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time . The 2060 has received rave reviews and is off to a great start . In addition , we announced a record of 40-plus new Turing-based gaming laptops , which became available on January 29 . This is more than double the number of GeForce-powered notebooks in the market last year , featuring the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture and the light laptops are able to deliver the performance of desktop gaming PCs . We expect GeForce laptops to continue to be the fastest-growing segment of gaming . We are also pleased to see growing momentum in the RTX ecosystem as more game developers are creating content to take advantage of the Turing architecture 's amazing capabilities . Just this week , DLSS technology is becoming available in 2 blockbuster games , Battlefield V and Metro Exodus and Anthem coming soon . In addition , at CES , Justice and Atomic Heart showed demos featuring ray tracing and DLSS . And a large pipeline of games plan to integrate RTX technology .

Moving to datacenter . Revenue was $ 679 million , up 12 % year-on-year and down 14 % sequentially . Full year datacenter revenue was $ 2.93 billion , up a strong 52 % . The Q4 sales decline was broad-based across vertical end markets and geographies . As the quarter progressed , customers around the world became increasingly cautious , due to rising economic uncertainty and a number of deals did not close in January . In addition , hyperscale and cloud purchases declined both sequentially and year-on-year as several customers paused at the end of the year . We believe the pause is temporary . The strength of NVIDIA 's accelerated computing platform remains intact . We continue to lead the industry in performance for scientific computing and deep learning . And with CUDA 's programmability , we can continue to expand the value of our platform . For example , we recently announced RAPIDS or CUDA acceleration stack for data analytics and machine learning . In December , the first objective third-party AI benchmark called MLPerf became available , and NVIDIA captured the top spot in the 6 test categories for training deep learning models that we competed in .

Our visibility remains low in the current cautious spending environment , and we do n't forecast a meaningful recovery in the data center segment until later in the year . However , we are working closely with hyperscales around the world to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT software and Tensor Core GPUs into their inference production flow . Inference currently drives less than 10 % of our data center business , but represents a significant expansion of our addressable market opportunity going forward . We have also strengthened our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities to address vertical industries that have an enormous data and analytics requirements , such as automotive , financial services , retail , health care and consumer Internet services .

When we launched the 2070 and 2080 , it was the first time we 've ever launched a new generation where the only available SKUs were very high end . And in addition to that , the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the overclock versions , and the MSRP versions did n't show up for some short time after , couple of months after . And so the conditions were n't ideal , if you will . Now we were n't able to launch into the mainstream segment with 2060 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now .

But it 's such a new technology with ray tracing and AI for image processing that it 's only really possible to make available with new games , which is tied to the schedules of new games . And now they 're starting to come out . Battlefield V , Metro Exodus , I think the reviews from this week are just spectacular . People are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about . And that it 's possible with RTX technology , the combination of applying ray tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance . And so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology . And we just needed some time to demonstrate it . And I think the takeaway is simply this . RTX is the best graphics card at every single price point without using ray tracing technology . And for new games that are coming out , each one of the new games that come out in the future will apply ray tracing , and work with developers to apply ray tracing technology .

And just at CES , the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture , you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time .

Q3 revenue reached $ 3.18 billion , up 21 % from a year earlier , with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits . Data center , professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels . However , gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through . Gaming card prices , which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff , took longer than expected to normalize . Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipments in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize . In Q4 , we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle . While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind , it does not change our long-term fundamentals .

While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind , it does not change our long-term fundamentals . Our competitive position is as strong as ever , and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcements . We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming , rendering , high-performance computing , AI and self-driving cars . GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points . This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $ 57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand . Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $ 1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter . From a reporting segment perspective , GPU revenue grew 25 % from a year ago to $ 2.77 billion . Tegra processor revenue was down 3 % to $ 407 million . Let 's continue with our gaming business . Revenue of $ 1.76 billion was up 13 % year-on-year and down 2 % sequentially . Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales , which more than offset gaming console declines . In mid-September , we began shipping GeForce RTX series , the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture . Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor , Pascal , and 6x more for ray-traced graphics . These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs .

These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs . The first 2 GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080 , delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles , a major milestone for gamers . This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points . These 2 end -- 2 high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce [ 27 D ] . NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before . The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing , enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs . With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features , RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture . Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended , the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize . Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX . However , on midrange Pascal gaming cards , both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected . Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays , and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2 . Moving to data center . We had another strong quarter with revenue of $ 792 million , up 58 % year-on-year and up 4 % sequentially .

We had another strong quarter with revenue of $ 792 million , up 58 % year-on-year and up 4 % sequentially . Demand remains strong for Volta architecture products , including Tesla V100 and VGX systems , and our inference business continued to grow , benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter . Just 2 months after its launch , the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU . It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform , its first cloud availability . The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads , including high-performance computing , deep learning training and inference , machine learning , data analytics and graphics . We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform . This new software includes 2 critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers . First , it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time . This can drive higher data center utilization , directly translating to significant savings . Second , it integrates with Kubernetes , the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers . Completing our inference platform , the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor . All told , our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs .

Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture , which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000 . With this product , Turing opens a new market to GPOs , photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real . Rendering is instrumental to large industries , such as media and entertainment , retail , product designs , manufacturing and architecture . Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities , GPUs were not able to address this workload . So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs . An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance CPU render farm is 1/4 the cost , 1/10 the space and 1/11 the power . NVIDIA 's RTX platform has garnered major industry support , including from key developers such as Adobe , ANSYS , Autodesk , Dassault and many others . Lastly , NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS , which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed .

With RAPIDS , NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning , as we have done with deep learning , with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs . The RAPIDS launch opens up a $ 20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs , and it 's received broad industry support , including from Oracle , IBM , SAP , Dell EMC , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , Microsoft Azure machine learning , Google , Q-Flow as well as the open source community . With one unified architecture and ecosystem , NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market , including scientific computing , deep learning and machine learning . Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads , ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers . Just earlier this week , this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas , where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48 % from last year , including the # 1 and # 2 systems in the world .

At SIGGRAPH in August , we announced our Quadro RTX 8000 , 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture . And earlier this week , we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000 , the most advanced professional GPU priced under $ 1,000 . These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows . The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3 , with the server-grade , high-end products recognized in data center . We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX , including the major movie studios and game developers , and the reaction has been very positive . Finally , turning to automotive . Automotive sales in Q3 reached $ 172 million , up 19 % from a year ago and up 7 % sequentially . This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation , AI-based cockpit infotainment systems . At GTC Europe , we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA 's DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars .

The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much , much more affordable way than Moore 's Law would have allowed . And then the third , which we just announced recently , is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU . And along with all of the software stack that we 've put on top of it , Kubernetes , the Docker , the TRT inference engine , our second-generation Tensor Core , AI accelerator , all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center . So I 'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Harlan Sur , JP Morgan Chase & Co , Research Division - Senior Analyst [ 4 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Nov-15", "chunk_index": 16, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Nov-15-NVDA.txt"}}

So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind , the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that . So it has been about 1/3 consistently over , let 's say , about an 8-quarter period of time . And we think that 's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4 .

This is one of the things that I 've talked about in the past that on the one hand , people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about . The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top . The TensorRT , fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3 , 4 years to build . And then on top of that , in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google 's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server , an inference server , that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud .

Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices . It could be manufacturing picking robots . It could be autonomous retail , basically AI retail , and autonomous warehouses . So -- or medical instruments , medical imaging instruments that , in the device itself , recognizes and identifies anomalies . And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI , and that 's the reason why we built Jetson . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 52 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Your", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Nov-15", "chunk_index": 54, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Nov-15-NVDA.txt"}}

The -- our data center business , I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me , Q3 , this last quarter , the inventory setback aside , I actually have to say that it 's one of the best quarter we 've ever experienced . And the reason for that is because our data center position , our accelerated computing position as a company , which is the foundation of this company , the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways . For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing , it was really following scientific computing , simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes . About 5 years ago , deep learning came into the fore , and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers ' hands all over the world . The area where I 'm super excited about right now are the 3 that I 've mentioned that we 've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS . The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there 's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering . They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore 's Law comes to an end . The second is opening up inference . The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year .

And we know for a fact that Moore 's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward . And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that . It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very , very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment , which these hyperscale data centers tend to be . And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers , to a TRT compiler , to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud , certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers , that process took us several years and it 's put us in a really great place . So T4 is really fantastic . And so that 's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning . The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning . This is where Hadoop goes . This is where Spark goes . This is where scikit-learn , Python , pandas .

All of the data scientists around the world in retail , in transportation and logistics , in health care , in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now . And this took a couple , 2 , 3 years for us to pull together . RAPIDS has been open sourced . You can go into the NGC cloud , download it . IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform . SaaS , SAP , Oracle , the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform . And so this is a new segment for us . The answer about our growth rate is , I believe , that our accelerated computing , our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter . Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform , it has -- and our RTX server film rendering , we surely have expanded our data center opportunity .

Starting with gaming . Revenue was $ 1.65 billion , was up 26 % year-on-year and up 24 % sequentially , significantly ahead of our expectations . The upside is broad-based across geographic regions , products and channels . Gaming 's growth amid the pandemic highlights the emergence of a leading form of entertainment worldwide . For example , the number of daily gamers on Steam , a leading PC game online distributor is up 25 % from pre-pandemic levels . And NPD reported that U.S. consumer spending on video games grew 30 % in the second calendar quarter to a record $ 11 billion . NVIDIA 's PCs and laptops are ideal for the millions of people who are now working , learning and gaming at home .

A100 is also getting incorporated into offerings from AWS , Alibaba Cloud , Baidu Cloud and Tencent Cloud . And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world , including Cisco , Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo . Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch , with 30 systems expected this summer and over 20 more by the end of the year . The A100 is already winning industry recognition . In the latest A100 training benchmark , MLPerf 0.7 , NVIDIA set 16 records , sweeping all categories for commercially available solutions in both per chip and outscale performance based on the A100 . MLPerf offers the industry 's first and only objective AI benchmark . Since the benchmark was introduced 2 years ago , NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference . NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest top 500 list of the fastest supercomputers .

In energy efficiencies , systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack . On average , they are nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs , measured by gigaflops per watt . The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA 's own new Selene supercomputer , which debuted as # 7 on the top 500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier . Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than 4 weeks using NVIDIA 's open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years . This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks , and it is a reference design . It 's available for our customers to quickly build a world-class supercomputer . We also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics , one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise workload . We enabled an acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA 's GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June .

Moving to the rest of the P & L . Q2 GAAP gross margin was 58.8 % and non-GAAP gross margin was 66 % . GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year and sequentially due to costs associated with the Mellanox acquisition . Non-GAAP gross margins increased by almost 6 points year-on-year , reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales and lower automotive sales . Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $ 1.62 billion , and non-GAAP operating expenses were $ 1.04 billion , up 67 % and 38 % from a year ago , respectively .

And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world . And as I mentioned , it 's not just about gaming . There 's just so many different ways that you could enjoy games .

With data center , the thing that -- the structural change that 's happening in data center are a couple of different dynamics that are happening at the same time . The first dynamic , of course , is the movement to the cloud . The way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different . And it 's really , really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer , which is basically everything . And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence . It 's a type of software that really wants acceleration , and NVIDIA 's GPU acceleration is the perfect medium , perfect platform for it . And then the last reason about the data center is the architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that 's driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged . And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers . But the computers of today are really disaggregated . A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time , which generates a ton of east-west traffic , and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models . And so because of this type of architecture , 2 components , 2 types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud .

And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated , the application is fractionalized and broken up into a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center . And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run , that transmission is called east-west traffic , and the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed , low-latency networking . And that 's what Mellanox is fantastic at . And so we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual , more digital , and that 's one -- that 's the reason why GeForce is so successful . And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven , and that 's the benefit of our GPUs . And then lastly , cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking , and that 's where Mellanox comes in . And so I think that this is -- the dynamics that I 'm describing are permanent , and it 's just been accelerated to the present because of everything that 's happening to us .

Turing , Turing the current generation that we 're in , is the world 's first ray tracing GPU . And it fuses -- the RTX technology fuses 3 fundamental technologies : the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics ; and we added 2 new technologies . One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene -- objects in the scene super , super fast . And that -- it 's a complicated problem . It 's a super-complicated problem . We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently . The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI , artificial intelligence , using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics . And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS , Deep Learning Super Sampling , which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples , essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it , remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image , and you run it through the deep neural network , it synthesizes a high-resolution image that 's really , really beautiful . And people have commented that it 's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution .", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Aug-19", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Aug-19-NVDA.txt"}}

We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that . So you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed . And so that 's called RTX . And Turing is probably not even close , not even 1/3 of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS , which is , as you know , the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world . And so we support this large installed base , and we 're in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX . And now with the new console generation coming , every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing , and they 're going to be creating much , much richer content . And because of multi-platform , cross-platform play and because of the size of the gaming platform , PC gaming platform , it 's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs , which is great for us . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Aaron Christopher Rakers , Wells Fargo Securities", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Aug-19", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Aug-19-NVDA.txt"}}

Thanks so much , C.J . We 're expecting a really strong second half for gaming . I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever . And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format . The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now , their gaming and their e-sporting , even F1 is an e-sport now . They 're hanging out with friends . They 're using it to create other content . They 're using game captures , create art . They 're sharing it with the community . It 's a broadcast medium . The number of different ways you could game has just really , really exploded . And it works on PCs because all the things that I described require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems or -- and -- but it requires an open system that is multitasking . And so the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming . And the second thing is that RTX , it 's a home run . We really raised the bar with computer graphics , and the games are so beautiful , and it 's really , really the next level . It 's not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Aug-19", "chunk_index": 30, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Aug-19-NVDA.txt"}}

Jensen , just following up on the data center business . As you probably know , quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next , call it , 6 to 12 months . Curious , is that something that you think about , worry about in your data center business ? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp ? And I guess the breadth that you 've built within your data center business across compute and networking , are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months ? And then the second one for Colette , just on gross margins . You 're guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially .

Thank you . So thanks for the question . The -- our data center trend is really tied to a few factors . One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence and all the services that are in -- by the cloud service providers . And I think it 's fair to say that over the last several years , the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific . And we 're seeing anywhere from 10x , 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that . And so in the last 3 years , we 've seen somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000x increase in the size of models , the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models . And so the # 1 trend that we 're probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-Aug-19", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Aug-19-NVDA.txt"}}

's question now , and I 'll answer this along with that . One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how -- what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand . And there are 3 big ones , just gigantic one . Of course , one of them is natural language understanding , the ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction , it 's called deep embedding , dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system , which is the second major breakthrough , the recommender system , how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody . Recommendation on ads and videos , and there are trillions of videos on the web . You need ways to recommend them , both the news and just the amount of information that is going to -- that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous . And so the first one is natural language understanding . The second one is the recommender system , gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years . And the third is conversational AI .

And I have n't even started talking about robotics , the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate and breakthroughs that we 're seeing in self-driving cars , the models there are really improving fast . And so the answer to you , Toshiya , and C.J . are kind of similar , that on the first one , we 're indexed to AI . The second , we 're indexed to breakthroughs of AI . So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology . And then the third thing that we 're indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud . It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud , remote graphics workstations in the cloud . And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud . You could do big data analytics in the cloud . And these applications , I 've just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud . These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures .

The storage , the networking , the security , the virtualization , they 're at the intersection of all of that . And I just described 3 dynamics that are very , very powerful and are at the early stages yet . And so those are the things that we 're really indexed to . And then lastly , when somebody adopts -- when we introduce a new platform like Ampere , we 're in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle , Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough . It 's the first universal GPU we ever created . It is both able to scale up as well as scale out , scale up as in multi GPUs , scale out is fractionalization , multi-instance GPUs .

And Toshiya , you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin . And within our Q3 guidance , we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2 . Most of that is really associated with mix but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have .

It 's a complicated thing , and we do it at high part . Then the second part of it is where architecture , where the process technology and the rest of the design process , the architecture of the chip , and the final analysis , what NVIDIA paid for , is architecture , not procurement of transistors . We 're paid for architecture . And there 's a vast difference between our architecture and the second best architecture and the rest of the architectures . The difference is incredible . We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time , irrespective of the number of the -- in the transistor side . And so it must be more complicated than that . And so we put a lot of energy into that , and then the last thing I would say is that going forward , it 's really about data center-scale computing .

Revenue was $ 634 million , down 10 % year-on-year and down 7 % sequentially , reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending . While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely , others paused or cut back . Despite the uneven demand drop -- backdrop , the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call . First , inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad-based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer Internet companies . As announced at GTC , Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscalers such as Google , Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers . A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adapting our GPUs for inference , including LinkedIn , Expedia , Microsoft , PayPal , Pinterest , Snap and Twitter .

Following the announcement of the pending Mellanox acquisition , we remain committed to returning $ 3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases . So far , we have returned $ 800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends . With that , let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 . While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth , our Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectations earlier in the quarter where our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019 . The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter , and visibility remains low . In gaming , the CPU shortages while improving will affect the initial ramp of our laptop business . For Q2 , we expect revenue to be $ 2.55 billion , plus or minus 2 % . We expect a stronger second half than the first half , and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time . Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2 % and 59.5 % , respectively , plus or minus 50 basis points .

Thanks for the question as we start out here . I think when we had discussed our overall data center business 3 months ago , we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low . We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter . As we moved into Q1 , I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed . We saw probably a combination of those moving forward continuing with their CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers . Some others are still in terms of the pause . So as we look in terms of with Q2 , I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility , not the best visibility going forward but still rock-solid to what we think are benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform .

And at this point , it 's fairly , fairly safe to say that the leadership position that we 've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next-generation gaming ray tracing into a standard . Almost every single game platform will have to have ray tracing , and some of them already announced it . And the partnerships that we 've developed are fantastic . Microsoft DXR is supporting ray tracing . Unity is supporting ray tracing . Epic is supporting ray tracing . Leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting ray tracing . And movie studios , Pixar has adopted -- announced that they 're using RTX and will use RTX to accelerate their rendering of films . And so Adobe and Autodesk jumped on top -- jumped onto RTX and will bring ray tracing to their content and their tools .

Colette , are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at a normal level when you look at the Q2 guidance ? Like are all the issues regarding inventory and other issues , are they over ? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more the normalized run rate for your PC gaming business ? And then Jensen , on the data center , NVIDIA has dominated the training market . Inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive . There 's a lot of talk of software being like more at the framework level . How should we get the confidence that your lead in training will help you maintain a good lead in inference also ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 32, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

When we look at our overall inventory in the channel , we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue . Going forward , we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day , at the beginning of the quarter . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jen-Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder , CEO , President & Director [ 27 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 33, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

It is very different than an accelerator strategy . For example , if you were building a smart microphone , you need an accelerator for speech recognition , ASR . Our company is focused on accelerated computing , and the reason for that is because the world 's body of software is really gigantic , and the world 's body of software continues to evolve . And AI is nowhere near done . We 're probably at the first or a couple of innings of AI at that . And so the amount of the software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve . Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today , whether it 's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost , which is actually right now the most popular framework and machine learning overall . And there 's so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers . And those algorithms and those hand-engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms . This whole body of software does n't run on a single function", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 34, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

This whole body of software does n't run on a single function accelerator . If you would like that body of software to run on something , it would have to be sufficiently general purpose . And so the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light . Meanwhile , it has the flexibility of CUDA so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and is being announced , being integrated into machine learning pipelines , in the cloud and elsewhere , and then also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms , image processing algorithms that do n't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives . And so our company is focused on accelerated computing . And speaking of inference , that 's one of the reasons why we 're so successful in inference right now . We 're seeing really great pickup . And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application , and let 's just use one application , one very , very exciting one , conversational AI , you would have to do speech recognition . You would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what the speech is . You might have to convert -- you have to translate to another language . Then you have to do something related to maybe making", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 35, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

You might have to convert -- you have to translate to another language . Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search . And then after that , you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech . While some of it could be 8-bit integers , some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point . And some of it because of development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point . And so the mixed precision nature and the computational algorithm nature or flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications to not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not . We run every single model . And if it does n't currently run , we 'll help you make it run . And so the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily . So our strategy is very different than an accelerator . I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers . And surely , there are a whole bunch being talked about , but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real , real workloads .

There 's a whole bunch of stuff that we 're working on , and I 'm anxious to announce them to you . But this is an area that is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge . But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car , it 's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments , agriculture , industrial inspection , delivery drones , all basically use essentially the same technique . And so this is the foundational work that we 're going to do for a larger space that people call the intelligent edge or computing at the edge . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 47, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

It 's improving , but the initial ramp will be affected . And so the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly , and it affected our initial ramp . We do n't expect it to affect our ramp going forward . And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light . And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU , which is super energy efficient , in combination , made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $ 799 , thin and really delightful , all the way up to something incredible with RTX 2080 and a 4K display .

And this year , we have some 100 notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions . And so I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks . And it 's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs . It 's the fastest-growing segment . It is very largely underpenetrated because until Max-Q came along , it was n't really possible to design a notebook that is both great in performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own . And so finally , we 've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and created powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that 's really wonderful to own and carry around .

Level 2+ , call it 2020 , late 2021 or like 2022-ish . So that 's Level 2+ . I would say 2019 , very , very early for robotaxis ; next year , substantially more volume for robotaxis ; 2021 , bigger volumes for robotaxis . The ASP differences , the amount of computation you put into a robotaxi because of sensor resolutions , sensor diversity and redundancy , the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm , all of it put together , it 's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation . And so the economics would reflect that . And so that robotaxi is kind of like next year , the year after , ramp . And then think of Level 2+ as 2021 , 2022 .

I guess , Jensen , you 've done -- you said in many forums that the move down to the new process node at 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach , and I agree with that . But maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around a 7-nanometer franchise in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program . And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here .

I understand there 's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue , but maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jen-Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder , CEO , President &", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2019-May-16", "chunk_index": 54, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-May-16-NVDA.txt"}}

We 're in a growth trajectory with gaming . RTX has -- took the lead on ray tracing and has now become the standard for next-generation gaming , support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet . And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented .

And we have the best price , best performance and best GPU at every single price point . And so I think we 're in a pretty good shape . In terms of process nodes , we tend to design our own process with TSMC . If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency , it 's off the charts .

And it 's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our Turing GPUs .

Revenue was $ 1.72 billion , up 68 % year-on-year and down 1 % sequentially . Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products . The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform . We also continued to see demand from upgrades , with about 35 % of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture . The launch of popular titles , like Far Cry 5 and FANTASY -- FINAL FANTASY XV , continued to drive excitement in the quarter . Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport , while the production value of games continues to increase . This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs . At the recent Game Developers Conference , we announced our real-time ray-tracing technology , NVIDIA RTX . Ray tracing is movie-quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting , reflections and shadows . It has long been considered the Holy Grail of graphics and we 've been working on it for over 10 years . We look forward to seeing amazing , cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year , with the pipeline building into next year and beyond . And we expect RTX , as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality , to continue driving gamers ' requirements for higher GPU performance .

And we expect RTX , as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality , to continue driving gamers ' requirements for higher GPU performance . While supply was tight earlier in the quarter , the situation is now easing . As a result , we are pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize , allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price . Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected , but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs , which are included in our OEM business , at $ 289 million . As a result , we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers . Looking into Q2 , we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about 1/3 of its Q1 level . Gaming notebooks also grew well , driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design . And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth , reflecting that platform 's continued success . Moving to data center . We had another phenomenal quarter , with revenue of $ 701 million , up 71 % year-on-year , up 16 % sequentially . Demand was strong in all market segments , and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI .

Stacy , so let 's see . Q1 , as you probably know , Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons . The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond , beyond comprehension , really . Those 2 games , a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor , has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world . And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on our GPUs from all over the world . Surely , there was scarcity as you know . Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter , and it drove prices up . And I think that a lot of the gamers were n't able to buy into the new GeForces as a result .

Joe , so as you know , there are 30 million servers around the world . And they were put in place during the time when the world did n't have deep learning . And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches , the accuracy of prediction , the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach . And in order to take this newer network -- and the software that 's written by deep learning , these frameworks , are massive software . The way to think about these deep neural nets is , it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it , and these networks are getting larger every year . And they 're enormously complex . And the output of these neural nets had to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets . How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very , very different . And how you optimize for different neural networks , whether it 's image recognition , speech recognition , natural language translation , recommendation systems , all of these networks have different architectures , and the optimizing compiler that 's necessary", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-May-10", "chunk_index": 17, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-May-10-NVDA.txt"}}

And so I think at the core , it 's about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward . With respect to the -- our ability to address the TAM , there are 3 major segments . There 's more than that , but there 's 3 major segments . One is , of course , training for deep learning .

We 've taken with GRID and our Quadro virtual workstation and now with Quadro -- with NVIDIA RTX , we turned the data center into a powerful graphic supercomputer . And so these are the various applications and segments of data center that we see . I think , in the case of training , we 're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world .

And the reason for that is because we want gamers to -- the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen . And we felt that using one gaming brand , a graphics card brand and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less -- causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted . And most of the ecosystem loved it . And some of the people really disliked it .

And our GPU approach , because of its flexibility , because of its performance , because of the value that we create , that as a result of the throughput of a data center , we save people so much money just in cables alone . Oftentimes , more than pays for the GPUs that they buy . And the reason for that is because the number of servers is reduced dramatically . And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration , and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that 's been created . With respect to benchmarks , you might have seen that earlier this week , we released 3 speed records . The fastest single GPU , the fastest single node -- single computer node . A definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system , one node . And one instance , one cloud instance .

I appreciate it . NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years . It took us 1 decade to do . We literally worked on it continuously for 1 decade . And to put it into perspective , it 's basically film rendering , cinematic rendering , except it 's in real time . It merges the style of computer graphics , rasterization , and light simulation , what people call ray tracing , as well as deep learning and AI , merged it into one unified framework so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time . What it currently takes is a server about a few hours , depending on the scene , it might take as long as a full day , take a few hours to render one frame . So it takes a server , one node of a server , several hours to render one frame . And in order to render 30 frames per second , just imagine the number of servers you need . If it takes several hours per frame , and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time , it basically takes a high-performance computer , a supercomputer , a render farm , that 's why they call it a render farm , it 's a full data center designed just for rendering .

Unfortunately , they are moving quite fast to the next question , so I was n't able to add on . But let me see if I can add on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality . Remember , in Q1 , we outgrew seasonality significantly . We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of the channel . We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available . We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately , and then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency-only boards . So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand . So that then takes you now to Q2 . But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1 , we do n't have to do those channel-fill dynamics again as we get into Q2 . But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available . So putting together Q1 and Q2 together , yes , we are within normal seasonality , again , for our guidance . And we 'll see how we 'll finish in terms of the quarter .

The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world . One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it 's not any sovereign currency . And it 's , in the digital world , it 's distributed . And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet . Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC . And GeForce is so broadly distributed , it 's available everywhere . And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along . We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners , and the major miners . And they represent the vast majority of the demand . And to the best of our ability , serve their needs directly and we call that CMP , and that 's why it 's not called GeForce . They 're called CMP . And we can serve those miners directly , hopefully , to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market . Because ultimately , what we would like is , we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them . And the gaming demand is strong . I mean , the bottom line is , Fortnite is a home run . The bottom line is , PUBG is a home run", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-May-10", "chunk_index": 60, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-May-10-NVDA.txt"}}

I mean , the bottom line is , Fortnite is a home run . The bottom line is , PUBG is a home run . And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic , as people know very well . And it 's a global phenomenon . These 2 games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe , as it is in the United States . And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale , you 'd rather play with your friends . So it 's incredibly social . It 's incredibly sticky . And more and more -- more gamers that play , more of their friends join , and more of their friends join , more gamers that play . And so it 's this positive feedback system , and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite , and it 's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying . And so I think at the core of it , gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel , so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter . And so the pent-up demand is quite significant , and I 'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-May-10", "chunk_index": 61, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-May-10-NVDA.txt"}}

Q4 revenue was $ 1.74 billion , up 29 % year-on-year and up 11 % sequentially with growth across all regions . Driving GPU demand were a number of great titles during the holiday season , including Player 's Battleground ( sic ) [ PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds ] , PUBG , Destiny 2 , Call of Duty : WWII , Star Wars Battlefront II . PUBG continued its remarkable run , reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players . These games deliver stunning visual effects that require strong graphics performance which has driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture . eSports continues to grow , expanding the overall industry and our business . In one sign of their popularity , Activision 's Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week . We had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs , big-format gaming displays , in a partnership with Acer , ASUS and HP . These high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and integrate our SHIELD streaming device , offering popular apps such as Netflix , gaming video ( sic ) [ Amazon Video ] , YouTube and Hulu .

We expanded the free beta of GeForce NOW beyond Macs to Window-based PCs , and we enhanced GeForce Experience with new features , including NVIDIA freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters . And updated NVIDIA Ansel 's photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay highlights for capturing gaming achievements . Additionally , the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth as it became the fastest-selling console of all time in the U.S. Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations . We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business , and some was met with our gaming GPUs . This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter . While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify , we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter . That said , our main focus remains on our core gaming market as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile . Moving to data center . Revenue of $ 606 million was up 105 % year-on-year and up 20 % sequentially . This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4 .

Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba , Amazon Web Services , Baidu , Google , IBM , Microsoft Azure , Oracle and Tencent . We continued our leadership in AI-trending markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training deep learning networks . During the quarter , Japan 's Preferred Networks trained the ResNet-50 neural network for image classification in a record 15 minutes by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs . Our newer-generation V100s delivered even higher performance , with the Volta architecture offering 10x the deep learning performance of Pascal . We also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA 's platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs . We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs . Hyperscale inference applications that run on GPUs include speech recognition , image and video analytics , recommender systems , translation , search and natural language processing . The data center business also benefited from strong growth in high-performance computing . The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore 's Law has begun to level off .

We increased our total petaflops of list by 28 % , and we captured 14 of the top 20 spots on the Green500 list of the world 's most energy-efficient supercomputers . During the quarter , we continued to support the buildout of major next-generation supercomputers . Among them is the U.S. Department of Energy 's Summit system , expected to be the world 's most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year . We also announced new wins such as Japan 's fastest AI supercomputer , the ABCI system , which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs . Importantly , we are starting to see the convergence of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster . Modern supercomputers will need to support multi-precision computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing . By combining AI with HPC , supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitudes greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics . We are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries , such as transportation , energy , manufacturing , smart cities and health care .

These emerging applications now represent approximately 30 % of pro visualization sales . We saw strength across several key industries including defense , manufacturing , energy , health care and Internet service providers . Among key customers , high-end Quadro products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization . Turning to automotive . In automotive , for the fourth quarter , revenue grew 3 % year-on-year to $ 132 million and was down 8 % sequentially . The sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment , which is becoming commoditized , to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software . At CES , we demonstrated our leadership position on autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnerships that point to AI self-driving cars moving from deployment to production . In a standing-room only keynote that drew nearly 8,000 attendees , Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier , the world 's first autonomous machine processor , will be available to customers this quarter .

With this growing momentum , we remain excited about the intermediate to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving . Now turning to the rest of the P & L . Q4 GAAP gross margins was 61.9 % , and non-GAAP was 62.1 % , records that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms . GAAP operating expenses were $ 728 million , and non-GAAP operating expenses were $ 607 million , up 28 % and 22 % year-on-year , respectively . We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth , including gaming , AI and automotive . GAAP EPS was $ 1.78 , up 80 % from a year earlier . Some of the upside was driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation . Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7 % compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5 % . Non-GAAP EPS was $ 1.72 , up 52 % from a year ago , reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5 % compared", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Feb-08", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Feb-08-NVDA.txt"}}

Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $ 1.36 billion , bringing our fiscal year total to a record $ 3.5 billion . Capital expenditures were $ 416 million for the fourth quarter , inclusive of $ 335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building . Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go-forward financials . In Q4 , we recorded a GAAP-only one-time net tax benefit of $ 133 million or $ 0.21 per diluted share . This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of forward earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax , hence , the one-time benefit . For fiscal 2019 , we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12 % , which is down from approximately 17 % previously .

It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers . Our GPUs , the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs -- one of our Volta GPUs would take something along the lines of 20-plus CPUs or 10-plus nodes . And so 1 GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would take 10-plus CPU-powered server nodes to keep up with . And then Tensor Core comes along last year , and we increased the throughput of deep learning , increased the computational throughput of deep learning by another factor of 8 . And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPUs . It 's very unlike a CPU where the instruction set remains locked for a long time , and it 's hard -- it 's difficult to advance . In the case of our GPUs and with CUDA , that 's one of its fundamental advantages , we can continue to -- year in and year out , continue to add new capabilities to it . And so Tensor Core 's boost of the original great performance of our GPU has really raised the bar last year .

If I had all the money in the world and I had , for example , billions and billions of dollars of R & D , I would give it to NVIDIA 's GPU team , which is exactly what I do . And the reason for that is because the GPU was already inherently the world 's best high-throughput computational processor . A high-throughput processor is a lot more complicated than linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsis tool , it 's not quite that easy . The computation throughput , keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency with all of the software that 's needed to keep the data flowing , with all of the optimizations that you do with each and every one of the frameworks , the amount of complexity there is just really enormous .

So the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks is just an enormous advantage . You do n't ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs could be used for one particular network or another . And so you could buy our GPUs at will and know that every single GPU that you buy gives you an opportunity to reduce the number of servers in your data center by 22 nodes , by 10 nodes , 22 CPUs . And so the more GPUs you buy , the more money you save . And so I think that capability is really quite unique .

We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well . We indicated how much we had in OEM boards , and we also indicated that there was definitely some also in our GTX business . Keep in mind , that 's very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customer . It is . But yes , there is also some in our Q3 , and we did comment on it . So here we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4 . It 's up a bit from what we saw in Q3 , and we do again expect probably going forward . I 'll let Jensen answer regarding the demand for gamers as we move forward . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jensen Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder , CEO , President & Director [ 19 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Feb-08", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Feb-08-NVDA.txt"}}

So if you -- one way to think about the pent-up demand is we typically have somewhere between 6 to 8 weeks of inventory in the channel . And I think you would ascertain that globally right now the channel is relatively lean . We 're working really hard to get GPUs down to the marketplace for the gamers , and we 're doing everything we can to advise Etailers and system builders to serve the gamers . And so we 're doing everything we can .

The way that it works is you take the output of these frameworks . And the output of these frameworks is a really complex , large computational graph . When you think about these neural networks , and they have millions of parameters , millions of anything is very complex . And these parameters are waves and activation layers and -- activation functions , and there are millions of them . And it 's millions of them that composes -- consists of this computational graph . And this computational graph has all kinds of interesting and complicated layers . And so you take this computational graph that comes out of each one of these frameworks , and they 're all different . They 're in different formats , they 're in different styles , they have different architectures . They 're all different . And you take these computational graphs , and you have to find a way to compile it , to optimize this graph , to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold , reduce the amount of conflict across all of the resources that are in your GPUs -- or in your processor . And these conflicts could be on-chip memory and register files and data paths , and it could be the fabric , it could be the frame buffer interface , it could be the amount of memory .

And so you 've got to figure out what all these different conflicts are , resources are , and compile and optimize to take advantage of it to keep it moving all the time . And so TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation -- graph compiler . And it targets each one of our processors . The way it targets Xavier is different to the way it targets Volta , the way it targets our inference , the way it targets for low energy , for different precisions . All of that targeting is different . And so first of all , TensorRT , the software of inference , that 's really where the magic is . Then the second thing that we do , we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks could afford to have 8-bit integer or even less , some really could barely get by with a 16-bit floating point and some , you really would like to keep it at 32-bit floating point so that you do n't have to second-guess about any precision that you lost along the way . And so we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph , computational graph compiler , to processors that are very high throughput , that are mix precision .

And this quarter , we started shipping . We -- looking outwards , my sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training . And the wonderful thing is everything that you train on our processor will inference wonderfully on our processors as well . And the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for offloading inference and training , the more money they save . And the amount of money they save is not 20 % or 50 % , it 's factors of 10 . The money savings for all of these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic . And then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines , which is self-driving cars . TensorRT also targets Xavier . TensorRT targets our Pegasus robot taxi computer . And they all have to inference incredibly efficiently so that we can sustain real time , keep the energy level low and keep the cost low for car companies , okay ?

And then lastly , a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for these generative designs . And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications , okay ? So AI , think of AI really as , in the final analysis , the future way of developing software . It 's a brand-new capability where computers can write its own software . And the software that 's written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves . And so you could teach , you could use the data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself .

A lot of near-term items here on gaming . So I 'll switch it to longer term . Jensen , at CES , I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally . And if my math is correct , then that would be up about 2x over the last 3 to 4 years . So the question is , is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period ? And given the recent demand dynamics , I think we 've seen that NVIDIA 's direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs at the prices that you intend .

Thanks a lot , Craig . In the last several years , several dynamics happened at the same time . And all of it were the favorable contributions to today . First of all , gaming became a global market , and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world . But second , because the market became so big , developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of a video game . They could invest a few hundred million dollars and know that they 're going to get the return on it . Back when the video game industry was quite small or when PC industry -- PC gaming was small , it was too risky for a developer to invest that much .

And so the production -- when a production value goes up , the GPU technology that 's needed to run it well goes up . It 's very different than music , it 's very different than watching movies . Everything in video games is synthesized in real time . And so when the production value goes up , the ASP or the technology has to go up . And then lastly , the size of the market , people have wondered how big the video game market is going to be . And I 've always believed that the video game market is going to be literally everyone . In 10 years ' time , 15 years ' time , there 's going to be another 1 billion people on Earth . And those people are going to be gamers . We 're going to see more and more gamers . And not to mention that , almost every single sport could be a virtual-reality sport . So video games is every sport . So eSport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport .

In the near term , I -- our path to that future , which I believe starts in 2020 -- 2019 , 2020 , but starts very strongly in 2022 , I believe the path to that , in our case , has several elements . The first element is that in order for all these companies , whether they 're Tier 1s or startups or OEMs or taxi companies or ride-hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or pizza delivery shuttles , in order to deliver -- in order to create their autonomous driving capability , the first thing you have to do is train a neural network . And we 've created a platform we call the NVIDIA DGX that allows everybody to train their neural networks as quickly as possible . So that 's first . The development of the AI requires GPUs , and we benefit first from that . The second is -- which we 'll start this year and next year , is development platforms for the cars themselves for the vehicles themselves . And finally , Xavier 's here . We have first silicon at Xavier 's , the most complex SOC that was ever made .

And there 'll be thousands and tens of thousands of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on Pegasus that the world is going to need . And so that 's the second element . The third element , in the near term , will be development agreements . Each one of these projects are engineering-intensive , and there 's a development agreement that goes along with it . And so these 3 elements , these 3 components , are in the near term . And then hopefully , starting from 2019 , going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond , the actual car revenues and economics will show up . Appreciate that question . And I think this is our last question , yes ? Well , we had a record quarter , wrapping up a record year . We have a strong -- we had strong momentum in our gaming , AI , data center and self-driving car businesses .

Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe , we had a very strong quarter . Q1 revenue was $ 3.08 billion , up 39 % year-on-year , down 1 % sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook , reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms . Starting with gaming . Revenue of $ 1.34 billion was up 27 % year-on-year and down 10 % sequentially . We are pleased with these results , which exceeded expectations in the quarter , marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 . Let me give you some color . Early in Q1 , as the epidemic unfolded , demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period . As the virus spread globally , much of the world started working and learning from home , and gameplay surged . Globally , we have seen 50 % rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform , driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user . With many retail outlets closed , demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally .

These laptops are the first to use our high-end GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs , which have been available for desktop since last summer . In addition , OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $ 999 , a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX , including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities . These launches are well-timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate . The global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA Nintendo Switch and our console business , driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year . We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft , the world 's most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube . Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections . Light that reflects , refracts and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog . Reviews for it are off the charts . Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner , and PC World said it was glorious to behold .

We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing . With that , let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021 , which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox . We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19 . We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40 % on a sequential basis and Pro Viz to decline sequentially . In gaming , while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores , we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-tail channels . Overall , the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict , given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy . Overall , we expect second quarter revenue to be $ 3.65 billion , plus or minus 2 % . The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue .

We have 75 notebooks designed for either mobile workstations or what we call NVIDIA studio for designers and creators . And the timing was just perfect . With everybody needing to stay at home , the ability to have a mobile gaming platform and a mobile workstation , it was just perfect timing .

Thanks a lot , Joe . So first of all , taking a step back . Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers . It was n't the case when we first launched Volta . If you went back to Volta , Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way , and it was really focused on training . It was focused on training and high-performance computing . We did n't come until later with the inference version called T4 . But over the course of the last 5 years , we 've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers . If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers , machine learning is now pervasive . Deep learning is now pervasive . The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense . It did n't used to be . People still saw it as something esoteric . But today , data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs .

And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse . And so that 's really -- that 's contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere . When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center , it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it . They have a large amount of workload that 's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs . And as you know , our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation . We 're forward compatible or backwards compatible . Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100 , everything that runs on V100 runs on A100 . And so I think the transition is going to be really , really smooth . On the other hand , because V100 and T4 -- which , by the way , V100 and T4 had a great quarter . It was sequentially up . And then on top of that , we grew with the A100 shipment .

We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66 % . This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level , even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that . The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox . Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well . But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward . However , it 's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go .

If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments . First is hyperscaler AI microservices , which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI . Whenever you shop on the web , it recommends a product . When you 're watching a movie , it recommends a movie or it recommends a song . All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website , the first 10 websites that they recommend . All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today . It 's the reason why they 're collecting so much data . The more data they can collect , the more they could predict your preference , and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet . It used to be largely based on CPU approaches . But going forward , it 's all based on deep learning approaches . The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics . And so this is very , very big deal . And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping . Second is cloud .

This -- cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen . The 2 powers that is really -- the force -- the 2 forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing . We 're perfectly , perfectly positioned to benefit from these 2 powerful forces . So the second is cloud computing . And that journey is -- has a long ways to go . Then the third is industrial edge . In the future , today -- it 's not the case today . But the combination of IoT , 5G , industrial 5G and artificial intelligence , it 's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry . And whether it 's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming , construction , industrial , every single industry will become a tech industry . And there 'll be trillions of sensors , and they 'll be connected to little micro data centers . And those data centers will be in the millions . They 'll be distributed all over the edge .

And I think your question is really good because now it 's a good time to think about where to double down . There 's a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed . And I think that once I say it , it 'll be very sensible . The first is that the world 's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud , that is going to accelerate . Every single company ca n't afford to rely just on on-prem IT . They have to be much more resilient . And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is going to provide them the resilience they need . And so that 's one . And when the world moves and accelerates into this $ 1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation , which is now $ 100 billion into that journey , it 's growing 40 % a year , I would n't be surprised to see that accelerate . And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that . The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system . The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar . And yet in the future , our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable . It 's going to be infectious disease . And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-May-21", "chunk_index": 40, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-May-21-NVDA.txt"}}

And that 's what you need to do . You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight , detect early warning ASAP .

There 's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home . And when people work from home , it 's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment , which is video games .

There are 3 classes of workloads , and they kind of came into acceleration over time . The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training . Deep learning training . And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink , 8 GPUs on one board , and that architecture is called scale up . It 's like a supercomputer architecture . It 's like a -- it 's like a weather simulation architecture . You 're trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up . And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms . And because they have a different degree of budget , and they want to get into it , a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes , the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express , not SXM , but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs . And so that versatility , V100 PCI Express ,", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2020-May-21", "chunk_index": 49, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-May-21-NVDA.txt"}}

And so that versatility , V100 PCI Express , not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs , but it was much more flexible for rentals . Cloud renting was really quite ideal . And then we started to get into inference , and we 're on our seventh generation of TensorRT , TensorRT 7.0 . Along the way , we 've been able to accelerate more and more . And today , we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that 's out there . And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision , which is called ( inaudible ) , reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application , where you have millions of queries , and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up , where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day . It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks . And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine . Scale out , it 's for millions of users , each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally , you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds .

Most data centers today has a storage server , has CPU servers , and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing , flexible servers based on V100 . And so the ability to predict workload is so hard , and therefore , the utilization of these systems will be spiky . And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things . So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are : number one , it is the greatest generational leap in history . I mean I do n't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x . And it 's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference , it is a gigantic leap forward . The second , it 's the first architecture that is unified . We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center . From data processing , it 's called [ ETO ] ; the engine , which many of you probably know , it 's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data . It used to be Hadoop , but now it 's Spark . Spark is used all over the world , 16,000 customers . We finally have the ability to accelerate that .

And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload . And then the third thing is it 's the first GPU ever , the first acceleration platform ever that 's elastic . You could reconfigure it . You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out . When you configure it for scale up , you 're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink , and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU . When you want to scale it out , that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs . Each one of those 56 partitions , each 1 is more powerful than Volta . I mean it 's really quite extraordinary . And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload , and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster ; and then number three , it 's elastic . You could use in the cloud , you could use for inference , you could use it for training . And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I 'm most excited about .

If you look at it for the full year and what we guided , we probably have about $ 1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses . Keep in mind , there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation . We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox , and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items . So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox . There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox .

And so today , the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that 's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting , from training video , from training a model to detecting unsafe video .

And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models . We did n't inference recurring elements at a time , which is probably the most important model today . Text language models , speech models are all recurrent , Euronet models . And so those models were early for us at the time . So number one is the diversity of workload . The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing . I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition . From where we are today , it 's only $ 100 billion industry segment of the IT industry . It 's going to be $ 1 trillion someday , and that movement is just starting . We 're also much more diversified out of the clouds . At the time , cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning . And today , hyperscale only represents about half .

We have every single size , and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics . This journey took 20-some-odd years . Inside our company , it took 20-some-odd years . And we 've been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company . And we made a general purpose . We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg , C for graphics , and then it became CUDA .

And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it ? And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough , of course , we know well now , and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the 3 pillars that ignited the modern AI , the big bang of modern AI . And the other 2 pillar , of course , is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data . And so the 3 -- these 3 ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training . But over time , we expanded training to have a lot more models . And as I mentioned earlier , the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system . It 's the most important model because it 's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way .

Yes , that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox , Mellanox and its employees . We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board . You are correct . We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me , not this quarter , this year . And that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings , and you should expect that as well .

It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox ' CX-6 Dx , which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing . It 's incredible security and has a single route of trust , and it 's virtualized . And so basically , we -- this EGX A100 , when you put it into a standard center x86 server , turns that server into a cloud computer in a box . The entire capability of a cloud , of a state-of-the-art cloud , which is cloud native , it 's secure , it has incredible AI processing , it 's now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box . The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable .

This is a big week for NVIDIA . We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade . We ca n't wait to tell you more about it , but first , let 's talk about the quarter . We had another strong quarter , led by data center and gaming . Q2 revenue reached $ 3.12 billion , up 40 % from a year earlier . Each market platform -- gaming , data center , pro visualization and automotive hit record levels -- with strong growth both sequentially and year-on-year . These platforms collectively grew more than 50 % year-on-year . Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $ 100 million while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $ 18 million , and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward . Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Aug-16", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Aug-16-NVDA.txt"}}

Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $ 1 billion for the third consecutive quarter . Profit nearly doubled . From a reporting segment perspective , GPU revenue grew 40 % from last year to $ 2.66 billion . Tegra processor revenue grew 40 % to $ 467 million . Let 's start with our gaming business . Revenue of $ 1.8 billion was up 52 % year-on-year and up 5 % sequentially . Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop , notebook and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year . Notebooks were a standout this quarter , with strong demands for thin and light form factors based on our Max-Q technology . Max-Q enables gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick or less . All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top-of-the-line gaming notebooks , just in time for back-to-school . And we expect to see 26 models based on Max-Q in stores for the holidays . The gaming industry remains vibrant . The eSports audience now approaches 400 million , up 18 % over the past year . The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new battle royale genre and expanded the gaming market . In fact , the battle royale mode is coming to games like the much-anticipated Battlefield V. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC-gaming platform for the release of Battlefield V", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Aug-16", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Aug-16-NVDA.txt"}}

Monster Hunter : World arrived on PCs earlier this month and it was an instant hit . And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season . It 's not just new titles that are building anticipation . The gaming community is excited over the Turing architecture announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH . Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU over a decade ago . The architecture includes new dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT cores and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing , which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time . We will enable the cinematic quality gaming , amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models . Turing will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs . Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years to -- of effort . It 's -- delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference flops .

We had another strong quarter with revenue of $ 760 million , accelerating to 83 % year-on-year growth and up 8 % sequentially . This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as Internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI . Our GPUs power real-time services such as search , voice recognition , voice synthesis , translation , recommender engines , fraud detection and retail applications . We also saw a growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries , representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business . Companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services through transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerating computing platform to turn data into actionable insights . Our flagship Tensor Core GPU , the Tesla V100 , based on Volta architecture , continue to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications . Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscale data center operator around the world . Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100 , which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32 gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks . Major server OEMs , HP Enterprise , IBM , Lenovo , Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32-gig to market in the quarter .

While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads , TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases , such as speech recognition , speech synthesis , translation and recommendation systems . This means we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads , delivering up to 190x performance speed-up , relative to CPUs . NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework , making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs . And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU , our small form factor GPU for AI inference and graphic virtualization , is available on Google Cloud Platform . Data center growth was also driven by DGX , our fully optimized AI server , which incorporates V100 GPUs , our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack . The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars . DGX-2 , announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference , is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter .

So first of all , Turing , as you know , is the world 's first ray-tracing GPU . And it completes our new computer graphics platform , which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether . It unites 4 different computing modes : rasterization , accelerated ray tracing , computing with CUDA and artificial intelligence . It uses these 4 basic methods to create imagery for the future . There 's 2 different -- 2 major ways that we 'll experience the benefits right away . The first is for the markets of visualization today , they require photorealistic images . Whether it 's an IKEA catalog or a movie or architectural engineering or product design , car design , all of these types of markets require photorealistic images . And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray tracing with physically based materials and lighting . The technology is rather complicated . It 's been computing-intensive for a very long time . And it was n't until now that we 've been able to achieve it in a productive way .

But if you look at the balance sheet , I think the inventory level is up by around mid-30s percent sequentially and you 're guiding revenue up 3 % or so .

Thanks for your question . So when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet , I think it 's generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market . Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture , and as you know , it will be with us for some time . So I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that . And do n't forget our work in terms of data center and what we have for Volta is also a very , very complex computer , in some cases , in terms of what we have also in terms of there . So just those things together , plus our Pascal architecture is still here , makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jensen Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder , CEO , President & Director [ 9 ] --", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Aug-16", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Aug-16-NVDA.txt"}}

Pascal , relative to Maxwell , was a leap in fact . And it was a really significant upgrade . The architectures were largely the same . They were both programmable shading , they were both at the same generation programmable shading . But Pascal was much , much more energy efficient . I think it was something like 30 % , 40 % more energy efficient than Maxwell , and that translated to performance benefits to customers . The success of Pascal was fantastic . There 's just simply no comparison to Turing . Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics . It is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world . It 's the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like area lights and global illumination and indirect lighting .

But there 's still some underlying points of that , that will likely continue . The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales , continued industry by industry coming on board , essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential .

Atif , let me just add a little bit more to that . I think the one simple way to think about that is this . In the transportation industry , let 's take one particular vertical . There are 2 dynamics that are happening that are very abundantly clear and that will transform that industry . The first , of course , is ride hailing and ride sharing . Those platforms , in order to make the recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger , to which customer , is a really large computing problem . It 's a machine-learning problem . It 's an optimization problem of very , very large scale . And in every -- in each and every one of those instances , you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match or the most optimal match . On the second -- the second is self-driving cars . Every single car company that 's working on robot taxis or self-driving cars needs to collect data , label data , train a neural network or train a whole bunch of neural networks and to run those neural networks in cars . And so you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars . And every single one of them will need even more GPU-accelerated servers . And that 's just for", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Aug-16", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Aug-16-NVDA.txt"}}

And that 's just for developing the model . Then the next stage is to simulate the entire software . Because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year , and the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles . And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress -- stress-test our software stack and the only way to do that is doing virtual reality . And so that 's another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software costs , those billions and billions of virtually created , challenging miles . And then lastly , before you OTA the software , you 're going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you 've collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars .

There are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs to autoencoders to RNNs and LSTMs , there is just so many different species of neural networks these days , and it 's continuing to grow .

We are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack . And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and , very importantly , they need low latency . Voice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time . And our platform is just really , really excellent for that . And then this last week -- this week , we announced Turing .

Although crypto revenue may not be large , it still has a derivative impact on our stock in terms of what we are selling in to both replenish the overall channel and such .

Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand . Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every 5 years . 10x every 5 years is approximately Moore 's Law . And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every 5 years , however , Moore 's Law stopped . And so that gap in the world in high-performance computing , in medical imaging , in life sciences computing , in artificial intelligence , that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability , that gap can only be served in another way . And NVIDIA 's GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered really stands to benefit from that . And so at the highest level , whether it 's supercomputing -- and this year , you heard Colette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56 % of all the new performance that came into the world 's TOP500 . The TOP500 is called the TOP500 because it reflects the future computing .

Number two , obviously , the stories about gaming and data center , and I know that you do n't typically talk about customers , but since Tesla did talk about you on their call , I 'm curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your drive platform . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jensen Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder , CEO ,", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2018-Aug-16", "chunk_index": 50, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Aug-16-NVDA.txt"}}

Well , the crypto mining market is very different today than it was 3 years ago . And even though new cards -- at the current prices , it does n't make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market . The existing capacity is still being used , and you could see that the hash rates continue . And so my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards . And then probably the more important factor though is that we 're in the process of announcing a brand-new way of doing computer graphics . And with the -- with Turing and the RTX platform , computer graphics will never be the same . And so I think this -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to do great .

Revenue of $ 501 million more than doubled from last year and rose 20 % on the quarter amid strong traction of the new Volta architecture . Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing .

HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Huawei in China , Inspur in China , Lenovo , have all announced that they will be building servers -- families of servers around the Volta GPU . And so I think we -- this ramp is just the first part of supporting the build out of GPU-accelerated servers from our company for data centers all over the world as well as cloud service providers all over the world . The applications for these GPU servers has now grown to many markets . I 've spoken about the primary segments of our Tesla GPUs . There are 5 of them that I talk about regularly . The first one is high-performance computing where the market is $ 11 billion or so . It is one of the faster-growing parts of the IT industry because more and more people are using high-performance computing for doing their product development or looking for insights or predicting the market or whatever it is . And today , we represent about 15 % of the world 's top 500 supercomputers . And I 've repeatedly said and I believe this completely and I think it 's becoming increasingly true that every single supercomputer in the future will be accelerated somehow .

And you need to do computing at a very large scale . You 're performing trillions and trillions of iterations . The models are getting larger and larger . Every single year , the amount of data that we 're training with it is increasing . And the difference between a computing platform that 's fast versus not could mean the difference between building a $ 20 million data center or high-performance computing servers for training to $ 200 million . And so the money that we save and the capability we provide is really , the value is incredible . The third segment , and this is the segment that you just mentioned , has to do with inference , which is when you 're done with developing this network , you have to put it down into the hyperscale data centers to support the billions and billions of queries that consumers make to the Internet every day . And this is a brand-new market for us . 100 % of the world 's inference is done on CPUs today . We announced very recently , this last quarter in fact , that TensorRT 3 inference acceleration platform and in combination with our Tensor Core GPU instruction set architecture , we 're able to speed up networks by a factor of 100 .

The other way to think about that is because the amount of -- the networks are getting larger and larger , and they 're so complex now . And we know that every network on the planet will run on our architecture because they were trained on our architecture today . And so whether it 's CNNs or RNNs or GANs or autoencoders or all of the variations of those , irrespective of the precision that you need to support , the size of the network , we have the ability to support them . And so you could either scale out your hyperscale data center to support more traffic or you can reduce your cost tremendously or simultaneously , both . The fourth segment of our data center is providing all of that capability , what I just mentioned , whether it 's HPC , training or inference and turning it inside out and making it available in the public cloud . There are thousands of start-ups now that are in -- are started because of AI . Everybody recognizes the importance of this new computing model .

And so these cloud providers , cloud platforms are just a fantastic resource for them because they could rent it by the hour . We created in conjunction with that , and I mentioned all the cloud service providers have taken it to market , in conjunction with that , we created a registry in the cloud that containerizes these really complicated software stacks . Every one of these soft frameworks with the different versions of our GPUs and different acceleration layers and different optimization techniques , we 've containerized all of that for every single version and every single type of framework in the marketplace . And we put that up in the registry -- cloud registry called the NVIDIA GPU Cloud . And so all you had to do was download that into the cloud service provider that we 've got certified and tested for , and with just one click , you 're doing deep learning .

When you have 4 or 5 different architectures to support , that you offer to your customers and you ask them to pick the one that they like the best , you 're essentially saying that you 're not sure which one is the best . And we all know that nobody 's going to be able to support 5 architectures forever . And as a result , something has to give , and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one . And if there 's 5 architectures , surely , over time , 80 % of them will be wrong . And so I think that our advantage is that we 're singularly focused . With respect to FPGAs , I think FPGAs have their place , and we use FPGAs here in NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGA is a chip design . It 's able to be a chip for -- it 's incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip , and so that 's its advantage . Our advantage is that we have a programming environment , and writing software is a lot easier than designing chips .

Let 's see . We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown 9 consecutive quarters , it has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we 're looking at . We have just never created a product like that before , and I think the reason for that is several folds . The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end . That 's just laws of physics . The end of Moore 's Law is just laws of physics . And yet the world for software development and the world -- the problems that computing can help solve is growing faster than any time before . Nobody 's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Amazon before . Nobody 's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Didi before . The number of millions of taxi rides per week is just staggering . And so nobody 's ever seen large problems like these before , large-scale problems like these before . And so high-performance computing and accelerated computing using GPUs has become recognized as the path forward . And so I think that that 's at the highest level of the most important parameter . Second is artificial intelligence and its emergence and applications to solving problems", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2017-Nov-09", "chunk_index": 38, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Nov-09-NVDA.txt"}}

Yes , listen , there 's a lot of news out there . I guess some of the things I take away , first of all , Raja leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD . And it 's a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly , incredibly important now . And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator . The modern GPU , we just left the word G in there -- the letter G in there . But these processors are domain-specific parallel accelerators , and they 're enormously complex .

The amount of software engineering that goes on top of it is significant as well . And so if you look at the way we do things , we plan a road map about 5 years out . It takes about 3 years to build a new generation , and we build multiple GPUs at the same time . And on top of that , there are some 5,000 engineers working on systems software and numerics libraries and solvers and compilers and graph analytics and cloud platforms and virtualization stacks in order to make this computing architecture useful to all of the people that we serve .

In Q2 , our four platforms contributed nearly 89 % of revenue , up from 85 % a year earlier and 87 % in the preceding quarter . They collectively increased 29 % year-over-year . Let 's begin with our gaming platform . Gaming revenue increased 18 % year on year to $ 781 million reflecting the success of our latest integration of Pascal-based GPUs . Demand was strong in every geographic region . The Pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances . It enables unprecedented performance and efficiencies for playing sophisticated AAA gaming titles and driving rich , immersive VR experiences . In our most successful launch ever , we introduced four major products . They are GeForce GTX1080 , 1070 , and 1060 for the enthusiast market and the Titan X , the world 's fastest consumer GPU for deep learning development , digital content creation , and extreme gaming . Wired magazine called the GTX 1080 an unprecedented piece of electronic precision , one that performs Herculean feats of computational strength . Forbes called GTX1060 , which brings a premium VR experience within reach of many , a fantastic product , and Hardware Canucks describes Titan X as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mind-boggling . The GTX 1080 , 1070 , 1060 , and Titan X are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide .

Moving to professional visualization , Quadro revenue grew to a record $ 214 million , up 22 % year on year and up 13 % sequentially . Growth came from the high end of the market for realtime rendering tools and mobile workstations . The M6000 GPU 24-gig launched earlier this year is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers . Digital Domain , a leading special effects studio , is using Quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials , which requires especially tight turnaround times . Engineering giant AECOM and the Yale school of architecture are using Quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows . Last month at SIGGRAPH conference , we introduced a series of new products that embed photo-realistic and immersive experience into workflows incorporating Iray a and VR . We launched the Pascal-based Quadro P6000 , the most advanced workstation GPU , enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before . We demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster .

This impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing , hyperscale data centers , and grid virtualization . Interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology . Hyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning . Both for training and realtime inference , particularly for natural lingual processing , video , and image analysis . Among them are Facebook , Microsoft , Amazon , Ali Baba , and Bidoo . Major cloud providers are also offering GPU computing for their customers . Microsoft Azure is now using NVIDIA 's GPUs to provide computing and graphics virtualizations . During the quarter , we began shipping Tesla P100 , the world 's most advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture . Designed to accelerate deep learning training , it allows application performance to scale up to 8 GPUs using our NV link interconnect . We also announced a variant of P100 based on PCI express that makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers . At our GPU Technology Conference in April , we introduced DGX1 , the world 's first deep learning super computer .

Data center -- our data center business is comprised of three basic markets as you 're alluding to . One of them is high-performance computing , and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market , very computationally intensive . A second market is grid which is our data center virtualization , basically graphics application virtualization . You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from data center to any client device .

The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far , and the reason for that is because high performance computing is a relatively stable business . It 's still a growing business , and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years . Grid is a fast-growing business . I think Colette said that it was growing 100 % year-over-year , but it 's from a much smaller base , and deep learning is not only significant in size , it 's also growing quite substantially . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mark Lipacis , Jefferies LLC - Analyst [ 4 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- That 's very helpful , thank you .

However , we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness , and so it 's too early to guess what 's going to happen to yields and margins long term .

Jen-Hsun , the first question is tied to PC gaming , very strong trends . I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal ? And , have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle ? Whether it 's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now ? And , how quickly they are refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jen-Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [ 11 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Sure .

Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world . And , in fact , only about one-third has even upgraded to Maxwell , and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter . And so , that gives you a sense of how much -- and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we 've ever made generationally in GPUs ever . It is not only high performance , it is also energy efficient , and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others . I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us , and it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago . One dynamic that 's really quite powerful is that the production quality , the production content is much , much higher in video games today than ever . And , the reason for that -- I 've mentioned several times in previous calls -- is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible , meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1 and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible . And so , the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations . This is a dynamic that 's relatively new . And so , as a result , the quality of games go up which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it . I think we 're absolutely seeing that dynamic .

That 's going to allow game content providers , game developers to aim even higher , and I think that that 's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming . I would say that there 's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well as you know very well which is eSports is no longer just an interest . E-Sports is a full-force global phenomenon and very powerful in Asia in just about every developing country , and of course , the western world as well . I think that on top of that , not only is VR off to a great start . We 're seeing some great content now . But , some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal , tapping into this grassroots but rather global interest in using video game as an art medium . We introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world 's first in-game photography system . It allows you to create virtual reality photographs , and it 's just really , really amazing .

Deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made a practical -- made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software . The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors , not one big processor , but a whole bunch of small processors . And , vitally , they 're connected by this connecting tissue . This connecting tissue inside our processor , connecting memory , connecting fabric . That makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously . That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago . That invention has really been groundbreaking . And so , the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially -- inspired by neurons communicating with each other all simultaneously . And so , the GPU was really quite a perfect match . If you look at deep learning today , five years later , I think that it 's a foregone conclusion that deep learning is being infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter , more intelligent , more delightful to consumers .

GPU computing is not just the GPU chip . It 's GPU architecture , it 's the GPU design . It 's the GPU system . All of the algorithms that run on top of it . All of the tools that run on top of it . The frameworks -- our collaborations with researchers all over the world . And so , that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations when we started this , we were in Kepler . Maxwell was some 10 times better , and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell . So , in just two generations , just five years time , we 've improved deep learning by an enormous amount , and the GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all of the work that we 've done to it . Our strategy -- and this is where we are different not only the focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing , but where we are really different , I would say , is our singular architecture approach to deep learning .

And , optionally , with discrete GPUs , you could build a car with auto-pilot capability or an AI co-pilot capability all the way to self-driving car capability .

We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know , and they can provide them in different sizes and shapes and styles and different thermal solutions and different configurations and different price points .

Thank you . Jen-Hsun , I wanted to ask a couple questions again on the data center business . The first being , we 've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be and for GPUs within that . So , it would be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that ? And then , secondly , is there a market there for an APU-type product in the data center ? I know you have project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective , but is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your Company that you are considering pursuing ?

Yes , first of all , the type of work loads in the data center has really changed . Back in the good old days , it largely ran database searches , but that has changed so much . It 's no longer just about text . It 's no longer just about data . The vast majority of what 's going through the internet and what 's going through data centers today as you know very well are images . They are voice . They are increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video . Live video , if you think about it for just a moment , it 's live video . So , it does n't stay in the server , and it does n't get recorded which means that if you want to enjoy that live video there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the data center that 's running realtime on their live video so that the person that might be interested the video stream that you 're streaming knows who to alert and who to invite to come and watch the live video . And so , if you think about data center traffic going forward , my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput , increasingly high multimedia content , and increasingly , of course , powered by AI and powered by deep learning . And so , I think that 's number one .

Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past , and so the architecture -- it 's a new computing model . It recognized it needs a new computing architecture , and accelerators like GPUs are really well -- a good fit . So , now the other question is how much . It 's hard to say . It 's hard to say how much . But , my sense is that it going to be alive , and without any predictions , it 's going to be a lot more than we currently ship . I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant . I think every hyperscale data center will be GPU-accelerated . It will be GPU-accelerated for training and GPU-accelerated for inferencing . There may be other approaches , but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that . And then , lastly , APUs . I guess my sense is for data centers , energy efficiency is such a vital part and although the work load is increasingly AI and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value .

I think it 's all of that . We have to keep pushing VR and get the head mounts out to the world . I think ACC Vive -- they 're doing a great job . Oculus is doing a great job . We track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there , and it 's growing all time . Second , the content is really cool and people are really enjoying it . And so , we 've just got to get more content , and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR . It really is a great new experience . But , it 's not just games as you know . One of the areas where we have a lot of success , and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and industrial design , in medicine , medical imaging , and architectural engineering . We use it ourselves . We are doing a fair amount of design of our workspace , and we render everything using our photo realistic renderer called Iray , fully accelerated by our GPUs .

And , it 's something else to be inside an environment that 's photo-realistic to be rendered and completely enjoying in VR . So , architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that . So , we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR . Now , one of the things that we did which was really spectacular is the multi-resolution , multi-projection renderings of Pascal . It 's the world 's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one , and the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display . You have one keyboard . You have one display . But , that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types . And so , multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics , and Pascal introduced it . You really benefit in VR . The second thing that we did was we integrated physics -- real world physics simulation into VR . The benefit is that without the laws of physics , as you know , you ca n't feel anything .

Thanks , Harlan . I appreciate the question . The team 's been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer aided design is done . Your observation is absolutely right , and it 's coming from several different places . First of all , more and more of design is really about product design , industrial design , where the feeling of the product , the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product . And whether you 're talking about a building or just a consumer product or a car , we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photo realistic way , using real material simulations . The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary . And we 're now seeing one", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2016-Aug-11", "chunk_index": 43, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Aug-11-NVDA.txt"}}

I think partly because , finally for all of the ISVs , of all the developers , not only is the market demand for earlier views of photo realistic designs an important decision criteria . They can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer . And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they put into their packages , if they rely on GPUs , will have the benefits of GPUs there . And so I think that 's the virtual cycle you 're starting to see in design . And so the investment that we made in the photo realistic renderings several years ago , the GPU acceleration of optics , this layer for path tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world , our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use , from computer graphics all the way to imaging , is something that I think is starting to see benefits .

Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses . And I think that going forward , your last question is going forward , do we see -- how do we see Pascal ? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world . And so I think in the coming quarters , we 're going to expect to see Pascal out there .

And the reason for that is because automatic braking and auto pilot on a highway and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car , a self-driving truck , a geofenced autonomous shuttle , all of these , a completely autonomous taxi , all of these platforms can not be solved by one chip . It 's just not even logical . The computation necessary to do it is so diverse . The more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances , the more nines you would like to have , if you will , the more computation you have to do .

In fact , energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward . And the reason for that is because every single environment that we 're in is power constrained , every single environment . Even your PC , with 750 watts or 1,000 watts , is power constrained . Because we could surely put more GPUs in there than 1,000 watts . And so that 's power constrained . We 're in environments where we only have one or two watts . It might be a drone and we need to be , we 're completely power constrained , so energy efficiency is really , really important . We might be in a data center where we 're doing deep learning and training we 're training neuronets or we 're inferencing neuronets . And in this particular case , although the data center has a lot of power to provision , the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens , tens and tens of thousands . And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue . Energy efficiency , literally , is the most important feature of the processor .

And so that 's a feature and an architectural innovation . And then lastly , of course , there 's all of the software that goes on top of the processor base .

FY17 revenue was just over $ 6.9 billion , up 38 % , and nearly $ 2 billion more than FY16 . Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad-based , with record revenue in each of our four platforms -- gaming , professional visualization , data center , and automotive . Our full-year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model . From a reporting segment perspective , Q4 GPU revenue grew 57 % to $ 1.85 billion from a year earlier . Tegra processor revenue was up 64 % to $ 257 million . Let 's start with our gaming platform . Q4 gaming record revenue was a record $ 1.35 billion , rising 66 % year on year , and up 8 % from Q3 .

The GTX 1050 and 1050-TI were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month 's consumer electronics show . To enhance the gaming experience , we announced G-Sync HDR , a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor . Our partners have launched more than 60 G-Sync-capable monitors and laptops , enabling smooth play without screen tear artifacts . E-sports too continues to attract new gamers . Major tournaments with multi-million dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences . This last quarter , Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston . Tickets sold out in minutes . The prize pool reached 3 million , and millions of gamers watched online . Moving to professional visualization , Quadro revenue grew 11 % from a year ago to a record $ 225 million , driven by demand for high-end real time renderings and mobile workstations . We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations , which leading OEMs are embracing .

In a series of related announcements at SC16 , we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshop project , in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute , the US Department of Energy , and several national labs . To help build predictive models and guide treatment under those projects , we are collaborating on a new AI framework called CANDLE , the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment . To support this work , we unveiled our new own super-computer , the NVIDIA DGX Saturn 5 , which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems . It 's currently the world 's 28th fastest super-computer , and the number one system in energy efficiency .

It 's currently the world 's 28th fastest super-computer , and the number one system in energy efficiency . Our grid graphics virtualization business doubled year on year , driven by strong growth in the education , automotive , and energy sectors . We are excited to be hosting our eighth annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11 . This will be the year 's most important event for AI and accelerating computing , and we expect it to be our largest GTC yet , attended by thousands of application developers , scientists and academics , as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives . Finally , in automotive , revenue grew to a record $ 128 million , up 38 % year over year . At Jen-Hsun 's CES opening keynote , we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles . With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform , we also showcased AI Copilot , a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences , monitor their alertness , understand natural spoken language , and provide alerts in dangerous situations . One of the highlights of CES was the demonstration of our own autonomous car , dubbed BB8 . More than 500 passengers took rides in the back seat without a driver behind the wheel . We announced a number of new partnerships at the show , among them were collaborations with Bosch , the world 's largest automotive supplier , and ZF , Europe 's leading supplier for the truck industry . Both center on developing AI car computers with Drive PX2 technology .

Jen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America 's President Scott Keogh . They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with level four autonomy starting in 2020 , powered by Drive PX technology . Audi will deliver level three autonomy in its A-8 luxury sedan later this year through its V-fast system , powered by NVIDIA . We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year 's end . During the quarter , Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA Drive PX2 platform in every new Model S and Model X , to be followed by the Model 3 . Tesla 's cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates . In addition , Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program .

Next , our OEM and IP business was $ 176 million , down 11 % year on year . Now turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4 . Gross margins were at record levels , with GAAP gross margins at 60 % and non-GAAP at 60.2 % . These reflect the success of our platform approach , as well as strong demand for G-Force gaming GPUs and deep learning . GAAP operating expenses were $ 570 million . Non-GAAP operating expenses were $ 498 million , up 12 % from a year earlier , reflecting head-count-related costs for our AI growth initiatives , as well as investments in sales and marketing . We are investing into huge market opportunities : AI , self-driving cars , cloud computing , and gaming . Thus we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters . GAAP operating income was $ 733 million , and non GAAP operating income was $ 809 million . Both more than doubled from a year earlier . Our GAAP tax rate was 10 % , and our non-GAAP was 13 % .

The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning , and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI , to achieve AI . If a computer ca n't learn , and if you ca n't learn continuously and adapt with the environment , there 's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence . Learning , as you know , is a foundational part of intelligence . Deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself , by learning from a large quantity of data . Prior to deep learning , other techniques like expert systems and role-based systems and hand-engineered features , where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect at cat , and then the - they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car . You could imagine how difficult that is , and how imperfect that is . It basically kind of works , but it does n't work good enough , well enough , to be useful . Then deep learning came along . The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because it 's singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network , and it requires an enormous amount of computation .

The list of the types of networks -- there are 100 networks being created a week . Papers are coming out of everywhere . The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust . It is incredibly useful , and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it 's figured out how to solve . I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super-important .

All we have to do -- it 's not trivial , but it 's also not monumental -- we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars , and we train our networks to do so . As you know very well now , the deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human-engineered computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning . That 's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach , and abandoned traditional hand-featured computer vision approaches . Anyway , the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars end to end , we realized that this is much more than computer vision , that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that 's quite complex , and now we 've had a lot of experience doing so .

As we move forward , as well , going into Q2 , we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2 . I 'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter , but keep that in mind . There 's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 , and then it depletes in Q2 . If you think about our overall model , our overall business model , it has moved to higher-end , value-added platforms , and that 's what we 're selling . Our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms . That gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx .

There 's so many different frameworks from Tensor RT to Cafe , to Torch to Tiano to MXNet , to CNTK ; the work that we did with Microsoft , which is really excellent -- scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks . That 's our deep learning stack , and that 's also very important . Then the third is grid . Grid is a completely different stack . It 's the world 's first graphics virtualization stack , fully integrated into Citrix , integrated to VMware . Every single workstation and PC application has been verified , tested , and has the ability to be streamed from a data center .

Just a quick question in the auto market . At CES , you had some solutions you were demonstrating that showed pretty significant declines in the size of what was being offered . You really shrunk it down a lot , yet still having great performance . If you think out to the level-four solution that you talk about for 2020 , how small can you ultimately make that ? It seems like you could be relative to the size of the car pretty small . Just curious if you would comment on that , and what impact having the system in the car makes on it ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jen-Hsun Huang , NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO [ 36 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- We", "metadata": {"company": "NVDA", "date": "2017-Feb-09", "chunk_index": 45, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Feb-09-NVDA.txt"}}

Some people are using many processors to develop their level five , and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their level four . Our next generation -- so that 's all based on a Pascal generation . Our next generation , the processor 's called Xavier . We announced that recently . Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one . We 'll be able to achieve level four with one processor . That 's the easiest way to think about it . While achieve level three with one processor today , next year we 'll achieve level four with one processor , and with several processors , you could achieve level five . I think that the number of processors is really interesting , because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion , and we 've got to do perception , we have to do localization , we have to do driving .

This end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking . I just do n't know where anybody else is currently doing that , with the exception of one or two companies . I think that 's really where the great complexity is . We have the ability to see and to optimize across the entire range . Now the other thing that we announced at CS that 's worth mentioning is that we believe in the future , level four means that you will have autopilot capability , hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios ; however , it 's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve level four .

I think first of all , the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected -- a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago . That 's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport . Not only is it a sport , it 's a social sport . In order to play some of these modern e-sports games , it 's a five on five , so you kind of need four other friends . As a result , in order to enjoy , to be part of this phenomenon that 's sweeping the world , that it 's rather sticky . That 's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard 's doing so well . That 's one of the reasons why Tensen 's doing so well . These two companies have benefited from tremendously from the e-sport dynamic , and we 're seeing it all over the world . Although it 's free to play for some people , of course you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it , and that 's one of the reasons why you need G-Force in your PC , so that you can enjoy these sports .

It is -- it will soon be the largest sport in the world . I ca n't imagine too many young people long term not coming into the sport somehow , as this sport continues to expand in genres . That 's one of the core reasons . Now aside for -- you asked the question about G-Force Now , which I really appreciate . The simple way to think about that is this . There are many computers in the world that simply do n't have the ability to enjoy video games , whether it 's extremely thin and light notebooks , Apple Macs , ChromeBooks , the integrated graphics that do n't have very good capabilities .
