Full year revenue grew 13 % and crossed the $ 70 billion mark for the first time , setting an all-time revenue record for the third consecutive year . Our data center , Internet of Things , Programmable Solutions , memory , Mobileye and modem businesses each set all-time full year revenue records . 2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel 's transformation to become a data-centric company , pursuing an expanded greater-than- $ 300 billion market opportunity . Intel 's collection of data-centric businesses grew 20 % in 2018 after adjusting for McAfee . The largest of our data-centric businesses , the Data Center Group , delivered record annual revenue of $ 23 billion , up 21 % year-over-year on strong cloud demand and growing share with communication service provider customers . Our PC-centric business achieved 9 % growth in 2018 as the PC market stabilized , and we gained share in modems . While 2018 was a record year , we expected a stronger finish . Fourth quarter revenue of $ 18.7 billion was up 9 % but short of our expectations as a result of a dramatically weakening modem demand , lower overall growth in China , cloud service providers absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment . While revenue fell short , we exceeded our EPS outlook by $ 0.06 or about 5 % . We continued to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and previewed new innovations that position Intel to compete and win for years to come , and we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI ,", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Jan-24", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jan-24-INTC.txt"}}

I 'll take a few minutes to give some specifics before we dive into the financial results . Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES , we highlighted breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for years to come . We outlined our product design philosophy , which combines 6 pillars of innovation : process technology , architecture , memory , interconnect , security features and software to consistently and reliably deliver leadership products that solve our customers ' most challenging problems . One example of this design philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D packaging technology . Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for the first time in the industry 's history and lets us mix and match process technologies and architectures to deliver breakthrough products . The first such product , Lakefield , is slated for production in 2019 . Lakefield features a 10-nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core , 4 low-power Atom CPU cores , Gen11 graphics and more in a dime-sized product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible . Foveros gives us tremendous design flexibility and paves the way for a myriad of devices and systems combining high performance , high density and low-power silicon process technologies .

In the data center , we began shipping the new Cascade Lake family of high-performance Xeon processors with DL Boost for accelerated AI performance , hardware-based security mitigations and the first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory . Many of our data-center OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials of Intel Optane DC persistent memory , which is enabling entirely new usage models and improved system performance . In client computing , we launched our new ninth gen Intel Core desktop product lineup for gaming and content creation , growth segments that demand Intel performance . We also previewed our upcoming 10-nanometer Ice Lake client CPUs , which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration , including DL Boost inference acceleration , WiFi 6 , Thunderbolt 3 and Gen11 graphics , our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance . Our 10-nanometer yields continue to improve , and Ice Lake remains on track to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling season . In Q4 , we also made important progress in AI , 5G and autonomous driving . For artificial intelligence , we saw accelerating adoption of OpenVINO , our open-source tool kit for neural network optimization and the rapid deployment of AI-based Computer Vision . In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer community , we also launched several new products during the year , including our third-generation Vision processing unit . Our partners created a catalog of AI-based Vision accelerator cards with our VPU and FPGA products .

Our partners created a catalog of AI-based Vision accelerator cards with our VPU and FPGA products . While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business , AI-based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts across all IoTG verticals . And our leadership portfolio , both hardware and software solutions , is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating IoTG 's growth . We also highlighted a new AI product on our road map , the Nervana Neural Network Processor for Inference , or NNPI , which is designed to accelerate inference workloads and achieve the highest performance per watt in the industry . We expect NNPI to be in production this year . 5G is another big opportunity for both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses . At CES , we unveiled the new 10-nanometer-based network system on chip , codenamed Snow Ridge , developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge computing . Snow Ridge will bring Intel Architecture into wireless access base stations and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the edge of the network . We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the second half of this year , which is also when we 'll deliver our first 5G modem , the Intel XMM 8160 5G . In autonomous driving and ADAS , mobilized effort to lead this revolution continues to build momentum with 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches in 2018 .

In the fourth quarter , we announced plans to commercialize mobility as a service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion Motors , making Mobileye 's breadth of products , technologies and services unmatched in the industry . Mobileye 's products now span from open ADAS and AV compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to , ultimately , mobility as a service . And they are enabled by the industry 's best vision algorithms and driving policy software , the groundbreaking RSS model for AV safety and REM real-time crowdsourced maps . At CES , we announced important progress for both RSS and REM . ITS , China 's leading industry organization for transportation standards , approved a proposal to standardize RSS for the China market . We also completed the mapping of Japan 's highway system , 25,000 kilometers of roads , using data harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 hours . This is a task that would have previously required thousands of hours of driving and scanning using specialized vehicles . This sort of breakthrough is possible only with Mobileye 's combination of technology and massive market scale , and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long before Level 4 and 5 autonomy are deployed at scale . And REM will be monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles . We just announced a partnership with Ordnance Survey who use data collected via consumer vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure .

Looking back at 2018 , it is abundantly clear that Intel 's employees , the unstoppable engine driving our innovation , are more determined than at any point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world 's most important innovations and advances . Not only was it a record year from a financial perspective , we achieved major milestones in terms of our diversity and inclusion goals . We reached full representation in our U.S. workforce 2 years ahead of our plan . We also achieved gender pay equity across our global workforce . And to celebrate 50 years of Intel , more than 68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the communities where we operate . I 'm proud of what Intel employees achieved in 2018 , and I am equally proud on how they responded to challenges . With that , let 's turn to the financial results . The fourth quarter closed a record 50th anniversary year with strong data-centric and PC-centric growth . Revenue for the quarter was $ 18.7 billion , up 9 % year-over-year . Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 9 % , and our PC-centric business was up 10 % . Operating margin of 35 % was approximately flat with strong mix and continued spending leverage , offset by 10-nanometer cost and growth in our adjacent businesses . Strong business performance , spending leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $ 5.9 billion , up 14 % year-over-year . EPS of $ 1.28 was up 18 % year-over-year .

EPS of $ 1.28 was up 18 % year-over-year . For the full year of 2018 , we generated $ 14.3 billion of free cash flow ; returned $ 16.3 billion to shareholders , including $ 5.5 billion in dividends ; repurchased 217 million shares ; and increased our buyback authorization by $ 15 billion . Free cash flow was $ 1.2 billion short of our October expectations due largely to an increase in accounts receivable . To summarize , we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year revenue up 13 % or nearly $ 6 billion higher than our original forecast in January . Earnings per share was up 32 % , and free cash flow was up 38 % over last year . We 're expecting another record year in 2019 . And as a result of our continued growth , we are raising the dividend 5 % . Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and our PC-centric businesses continued to grow in the fourth quarter . Our data-centric businesses were up 9 % for the quarter as customers choose our performance products to move , store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge . And our PC-centric business was up 10 % as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and regained modem share . Moving to earnings . We generated solid EPS expansion in the quarter , up 18 % year-over-year , and our operating income increased $ 580 million with operating margin approximately flat year-over-year in the quarter", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Jan-24", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jan-24-INTC.txt"}}

We generated solid EPS expansion in the quarter , up 18 % year-over-year , and our operating income increased $ 580 million with operating margin approximately flat year-over-year in the quarter . Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for higher-performance products in the data center and client businesses , leading to higher volumes and ASPs , continued spending leverage , a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks . Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results with 2018 spending as a percentage of revenue at 28.6 % , down over 7 points since 2015 and meeting our 30 % commitment 2 full years ahead of our goal . R & D is up $ 1.4 billion over the same period as we continue to increase investment in areas that will drive growth in our expanded TAM such as product leadership , artificial intelligence and autonomous driving . Over the last 3 years , we 've grown annual revenue by more than $ 15 billion while adding less than $ 250 million in spending , resulting in a more than 25 % increase in revenue per employee . Now some Q4 performance highlights by segment . The Data Center Group delivered another greater-than- $ 6 billion revenue quarter and a growing storage and networking CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units . Revenue of $ 6.1 billion was up 9 % year-over-year but below our October expectations .

Year-over-year growth decelerated as all 3 major verticals within DCG were impacted by weakness in China demand and as some CSPs moved to consume capacity put in place earlier in the year . Platform unit volume was up 9 % , and ASPs were up 1 % . Our Xeon ASP grew mid-single digits as customers continue to transition to Xeon Scalable and a richer mix of higher-performance products . We also saw ASP expansion in our SoC products and much higher SoC volume as we continued to have success in network transformation . The higher SoC volumes resulted in more modest blended platform ASP growth . Non-CPU adjacencies were down 2 % , driven by several large onetime deals in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter '18 . Cloud revenue grew 24 % year-over-year , decelerating from Q3 '18 . Enterprise and government revenue declined 5 % year-over-year on a very challenging compare versus fourth quarter 2017 and weaker China demand . Comms service provider revenue grew 12 % year-over-year on continued MSS gains as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks on Intel Architecture . Our other data-centric businesses , IoTG , NSG and PSG , achieved solid growth in Q4 , together were up 9 % year-over-year or 13 % excluding the Wind River divestiture . Our Internet of Things business had revenue of $ 816 million , down 7 % or up 4 % excluding Wind River , with operating profit of $ 189 million , down 27 % year-over-year due primarily to supply constraints .

Mobileye revenue was $ 183 million , up 43 % over last year as design wins and ADAS adoption continue to accelerate . Our memory business delivered revenue of $ 1.1 billion , up 25 % year-over-year due to strong data center growth and continued Optane adoption offset by a weaker NAND pricing environment . The shift of our data center and client SSDs to our 64-layer 3D NAND continues in both the data center and client businesses with volume mix greater than 75 % . NSG was approximately breakeven for the year . As expected , Micron exercised its right to call Intel 's interest in our joint venture IM Flash Technologies . This announcement does not change Intel 's plans in the coming quarters , and the close of the call is at our discretion up to 1 year after the date of the call with a supply agreement that extends beyond the close . We have manufacturing options available and have been shipping a broad portfolio of Intel Optane technology products for more than a year . We will continue to expand our product line and lead the industry with this exciting new technology . PSG 's revenues came in at $ 612 million , up 8 % on strength in the data center and comms segments . We saw continued momentum in PSG 's data center segment , up 50 % over last year .

Finally , the Client Computing Group delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue of $ 9.8 billion , up 10 % year-over-year . Commercial and gaming demand continued to be strong . The notebook segment grew 8 % year-over-year . The desktop segment grew 3 % year-over-year . Supply remained constrained , particularly at the value end of our product range . We are working closely with our customers to align demand with available supply while we add capacity , and we expect supply-demand balance to improve by midyear . Client adjacencies grew 45 % year-over-year , driven primarily by increased modem share gains . Though modem revenue fell significantly below our expectations as a result of weaker smartphone demand . Our operating profit grew $ 402 million year-over-year with operating margin up 1 point . While our PC volumes were down 2 % , our leadership product performance and segmentation contributed to strong mix . The investments we have made in the business organically and through acquisition are delivering excellent cash flow generation . For 2018 , we generated $ 29.4 billion in cash from operations . We invested $ 15.2 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $ 14.3 billion in free cash flow , up 38 % year-on-year and closing the gap versus EPS by 4.5 points .

Those incremental headwinds are impacting our revenue expectations and slightly reducing our operating margin percentage forecast . The remaining factors are roughly consistent with our October assessment . Now turning to our outlook for 2019 . We expect 2019 to be another record year for us as the world 's appetite for the analysis , transmission and storage of data continues to grow . We are forecasting revenue of approximately $ 71.5 billion , up 1 % year-on-year , and operating margin of approximately 34 % , down less than a point year-on-year . We expect a modest decrease in gross margin percentage driven by the 10-nanometer ramp and the growth of our adjacencies . This will be partially offset by increasing OpEx leverage as we continue to make thoughtful tradeoffs and invest in R & D that will accelerate our growth and profitability . We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 13.5 % , following several beneficial discrete events in 2018 , and we expect EPS of $ 4.60 .

Thanks for your one question , John . I 'll take a stab , and then Navin is here with me as well , I 'm sure he has a few comments . First , I would say that since we look at just overall demand for the data center environment , the end user demand by consumers and by enterprises , the workloads that we 're seeing , the continued growth in workloads , we are as excited about the future as we 've ever been .

As you know , the purchases are done in -- kind of in cycles , massive purchases through the first 9 months . And we started to see some of those purchases consumed in the fourth quarter . And we end the year , we think , with inventory levels on the server side of the business just a little bit higher than they had been historically . So as we project forward in the first 6 months of the year , we think that it 's going to continue to be both consumption on the server side and pricing in the NSG environment to be down through the first 6 months .

The product features look very compelling . The AI capability we have with DL Boost , the support for Optane persistent memory , the security , hardware mitigation fixes , so that the customer momentum around that product line looks very strong .

And roughly flattish for the full year would suggest that overall , you 're looking for a revenue trajectory in 2019 that 's very similar to the trajectory you had in 2018 , which was very , very strong sequentially , in many of the quarters . So I guess , what is the risk , just given everything that 's going on that that may be too aggressive , especially as you had a number of drivers in 2018 , both on the data center as well as on the client side , that are n't going to be repeating in 2019 ?

So my understanding is that last year , you spent about $ 3 billion there , with about half of that money actually coming from your clients , so not being actually Intel capital being deployed . So if you had $ 1.5 billion of Intel capital deployed in memory last year , if I look at your guide and seeing logic is slightly up , memory is going to be slightly down , so the actual Intel capital invested , deployed into memory this year is going to be up massively , maybe close to 2x . And that 's in a year in which everybody in the value chain , everybody in the memory industry is actually pulling back on CapEx and limiting capacity addition .

First , just to maybe start with as we see kind of free cash flow for the year , we expect to be up $ 2 billion year-on-year with gross capital relatively flat . And I think you said this , but just to repeat , $ 15.5 billion going to $ 15.5 billion . During the course of '19 , our expectations are , of that mix , that we 'll be more logic-oriented . And that 's really driven by a couple of things : one , ensuring we have the capacity to meet the 14-nanometer demand for our customers ; secondly , as we ramp 10-nanometer in 2019 and position for 10- in 2020 , we 'll invest additional capital there ; and then third , obviously , our expectations are to continue to invest in next-node technology , in particular , 7-nanometer . So logic capital is going to be going up year-on-year . And as we indicated , memory capital will be coming down .

So first , gross margin . The qualitative context is we expect gross margin to come down modestly off of Q4 levels and a little bit more off full year '18 levels . And we do expect that that will be largely , although not completely , offset by spending as a percentage of revenue coming down again in 2019 . I think just on the gross margin , the trends are going to be a little bit similar to what you 've seen in the past , although we do expect a little bit less ASP -- gross margin improvement from ASP . We expect unit cost to be up a little bit , and that will be primarily as we ramp 10-nanometer .

On spending , as you know , we kind of -- we exit this year with spending levels down in the -- 26 % in the fourth quarter and a little under 29 % for the full year . So we 're way ahead of our -- the 3-year plans that we laid out a couple of years ago , and we feel pretty good about the progress we made on the spending . And we 've done it without cutting R & D . During that time frame , R & D has grown . We 've been investing in the right things . Those things are growing faster . As a result , spending has come down 700 points from 2015 levels . As we go into 2019 , spending overall , we expect to come down . Some things we did during the course of the second half of '18 , including the exit of -- we exited Wind River . We exited wearables .

Thanks , Vivek , Navin here . Look , we 've been -- over the last 18 months , been working hard to diversify the end customer segment mix inside of DCG , and there 's 3 large components : the enterprise and government segment , the cloud segment and the comms segment . Cloud and comms is about 2/3 of the business now , where it was about 1/3 several years ago . And so I do n't see any major changes to the way things play out in terms of where the growth will come from as we look into 2019 and beyond . While the first half in the cloud will be a little bit tougher , we do expect that cloud continues to grow as they start to move and to build out again in the second half .

First , in the fourth quarter , just in terms of isolating how we prioritize our capacity , there were no shortages within the client business , prioritization of big core and , to a lesser extent , small core , lower value-oriented products . And so we did -- we do feel like we constrained a fairly healthy PC ecosystem in the fourth quarter . I think when the dust settles on PC TAM , our expectation is it was probably flat and our shipments were down 2 % . That was a function of we delivered every product that we could right up through December 30 -- 31 . So we did have some constraints on the ecosystem and on our customers during the course of the quarter . At the end of the year , Chris , I think inventory levels relative to the beginning of the year were a little bit higher , maybe a 1.5 weeks , 2 weeks higher as we entered the year . And our expectations for the year is the PC TAM is going to be relatively flat . And that , for us , is a good place to be . We 're probably halfway through the PC refresh cycle . We feel things have been relatively flat during the year .

So that continues to bode well for our product launch ambitions , which Bob summarized as having systems on the shelf for holiday season in 2019 , with a barrage of products across all of our businesses to follow shortly thereafter .

When we look at the technologies that we believe are going to be imperatives going forward in this increasingly data-centric world : process , CPU architecture , interconnect , software , memory is a key component . And all the advancements in CPUs will be constrained if you do n't have differentiated technology in memory . So we think that the role memory plays going forward is increasingly important . In terms of the -- just the CFO lens of having a commodity in the portfolio , I 'm not too excited about it . And that 's why the investments we 're making in memory are for , what we believe , differentiated technology , both in the manufacturing process capabilities of 3D NAND but also the differentiated technology for Optane and the role that it plays , both on the PC side but , most importantly , for us on the data-centric side . So we 're not particularly excited about commodities . When we make these investments , it 's really geared towards products and technologies that are increasingly important and those technologies that are differentiated from kind of the core memory space that help us , in conjunction with the CPU , solve customers ' problems . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Jan-24", "chunk_index": 45, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jan-24-INTC.txt"}}

Q3 2019 was the best quarter in our company 's history . We generated $ 19.2 billion in revenue and $ 1.42 in non-GAAP EPS , exceeding our guidance by $ 1.2 billion and $ 0.18 , respectively . We achieved record revenue both overall and in our data-centric businesses while making continued progress on our strategic priorities . Simply put , our ambitions have never been greater . We are growing share in a large and expanding $ 300 billion market opportunity fueled by the exponential growth of data , which is reshaping computing . I want to start with a recap of our May Analyst Day and our 3 priorities : Accelerating growth , improving execution and deploying capital for attractive returns . First , growth . It starts with a core belief . We are at a key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive demand for semiconductors . Cloud workloads are diversifying . Networks are transforming . And more computing performance is moving to the edge . We 've been on a multiyear journey to reposition the company 's portfolio to take advantage of this industry catalyst . Today , we have the product and technology leadership that uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and will invest in the IP required to help our customers win the inflections of the future .

The opportunity is massive . As we told you in May , we expect to generate $ 85 billion in revenue and $ 6 in EPS in 3 to 4 years . But that does n't happen just by saying it . Achieving this goal means delivering on our operational and financial priorities every 90 days . Growth starts with our Core business where our workload-optimized platforms are winning in a highly competitive marketplace . It 's now been 9 quarters since the first Xeon Scalable processor launched , and we 're proud to have delivered over 23 million units as customers rely on Xeon to power their data-centric workloads . In the third quarter , leading cloud customers ramped our second-generation Xeon Scalable processors with AWS , Google and Alibaba deploying instances based on Cascade Lake . Customers including BP and TU Darmstadt selected our highest-performance Xeon Scalable platform , the 9200 series , for their most demanding workloads . One key reason customers are choosing Xeon Scalable is the platform 's built-in workload acceleration for AI . With the combination of Intel Deep Learning Boost and AVX-512 technologies , we 're seeing advantages of up to 9x in AI inference versus competitor CPUs . We also see cloud and enterprise momentum building for our break-through memory technology , Intel Optane . This quarter , we announced a strategic collaboration with Oracle .

Oracle is incorporating the high-performance capabilities of Intel Optane DC persistent memory into its next-generation Exadata platform , which powers high-performance database infrastructure at most of the world 's leading banks , telecoms and retailers . And in client computing , we 're excited that all our major PC OEM customers have Ice Lake designs , with 18 already shipping out of a total of 30 expected to launch this year . We recently announced the next generation of Intel Xeon W and X-series processors for high-end desktops . These platforms lead the industry in bringing Intel Deep Learning Boost-powered AI acceleration into high-end PCs and mainstream workstations for the first time . Available soon , these products deliver performance and value that give enthusiasts and creators more reasons to keep choosing Intel . We 've also embarked on a multiyear program , called Project Athena , that charts a course for the PC ecosystem to raise the bar on laptop innovation . Amazing devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the HP Elite Dragonfly that meet the Project Athena spec are already available . Our PC and server franchises are vital , but our ambitions are even greater . We 're extending our product leadership to power an increasingly 5G- and AI-enabled world . We have multibillion-dollar networking and IoT/Edge businesses delivering double-digit growth , and AI is driving significant revenue across our product portfolio . We began investing 10 years ago in network IP , SoC capabilities and software so that we could drive workload convergence on Intel 's silicon .

Today , we achieved # 1 share in the network and silicon market with expected 2019 revenue of more than $ 5 billion , growing at 12 % this year . We 're also well-positioned for 5G deployments in 2020 and expect to grow our market segment share in wireless base stations to 40 % by 2022 . And we 're ready for the next market inflection as 5G enables significant new IoT and Edge growth opportunities that extend from in-network and on-premise Edge equipment to smart connected endpoints . Winning here means blending the right compute performance per watt with the emerging killer apps of the Edge , Computer Vision and AI inference acceleration . These are the differentiating capabilities that have propelled our IOTG and Mobileye businesses to leadership share and the combined annual revenues approaching $ 5 billion . The businesses are also growing quickly , up 18 % year-to-date , excluding Wind River . We 're only at the bend of the curve in the Edge opportunity , and we 're investing to lead . Finally , artificial intelligence . AI is becoming a pervasive use case . According to IDC , 75 % of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021 , and that 's why we 're infusing AI in everything we build . But this is n't just about the future .

We 're confident in our growth , but we also need to improve our execution on multiple fronts . First , supply . We 've increased our output in response to stronger-than-expected demand . We 've invested record levels of CapEx the last 2 years to expand our capacity and support our customers ' growth . With that investment , we 've increased our 14-nanometer capacity 25 % this year while also ramping 10-nanometer production . We expect our second half PC Client supply will be up double digits compared to the first half , and we expect to further increase our PC Client supply by mid- to high single digits in 2020 . But that growth has n't been sufficient . We 're letting our customers down , and they 're expecting more from us . PC demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed third-party forecasts . We now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2 , which has made building inventory buffers difficult . We are working hard to regain supply/demand balance , but we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter . Our manufacturing process node execution is also improving .

DCG , IOTG , NSG and Mobileye all individually achieved record revenue in the quarter . PC-centric revenue was down 5 % year-on-year on a very tough compare . Q3 operating margin was approximately 36 % , 1 point ahead of our guide on revenue strength and spending leverage . Gross margin for the quarter was 60.4 % , modestly below expectations as strong flow-through of higher DCG revenue was more than offset by mix effects of higher-than-expected NAND revenues and onetime impacts in NSG , including the absence of an expected grant associated with our NAND factory . Q3 EPS was $ 1.42 , $ 0.18 above our guide . The results demonstrate strong top line performance , expense discipline , increased share buybacks as well as nonoperational factors like lower tax rate offset by the onetime items in our NSG business . Year-to-date , we have generated $ 11.7 billion of free cash flow and returned $ 14.3 billion to shareholders . Operating margin of 36 % in quarter was down approximately 4 points versus last year as ASP strength in our server and client businesses and lower spending were more than offset by NAND pricing degradation , changes in modem reserves , platform volume declines and higher cost as we ramp our 10-nanometer client products .

Let 's move to segment performance . Our Data Center Group had record revenue at $ 6.4 billion , up 4 % from the prior year and up 28 % sequentially . These results beat our expectations with platform ASPs up 9 % year-over-year on strong adoption of our highest performance 2nd Gen Xeon Scalable products . Against a tough year-over-year compare , platform units were down 6 % while DCG adjacencies achieved 12 % revenue growth driven by our connectivity solutions . DCG growth segments , cloud and comms , now represent over 2/3 of total DCG revenue . Cloud revenue was up 3 % year-over-year , returning to growth after a historic 2018 platform refresh as cloud service providers exited a 3-quarter capacity absorption cycle . Enterprise and government revenue came in ahead of expectations , growing 1 % on strong mix and better China demand , while communication service providers revenue increased 11 % on continued adoption and share gains of IA-based solutions .

IOTG operating income was down 4 % year-over-year due to lower benefits from inventory reserves and a mix shift to lower-margin products . Mobileye revenue and operating income were up year-over-year , 20 % and 29 % , respectively , on continued ADAS penetration and new program launches . NSG revenue returned to growth , up 19 % on continued bit growth , partially offset by year-over-year pricing declines . These pricing declines , along with the onetime impacts discussed earlier , contributed to NSG 's operating loss of approximately $ 500 million .

First , we gave a DC-centric guide of 6 % to 8 % . And yes , I would -- we did n't give DCG specifically , but I would say it 's a little bit lower than our 6 % to 8 % data center growth , so you 're in the ballpark . On comms service , the comms -- this has been an extremely important aspect of the business for a number of years now where we 've seen the programmability at the networks with NFV and software-defined networks an opportunity for us to migrate the networking environment to IA architecture . So we 've been doing this for a number of years . It 's been a fulsome growth for us over time .

I want to stick with DCG , Bob . If you look , impressive , but ASPs were up 9 % year-over-year , especially as the mix shifted towards the comms business , which I believe tends to be lower ASPs . It 's also happening in the quarter where you 're seeing your competitor ramping their next-generation chips . So I guess I 'm trying to understand what 's the power of the Xeon Scalable upgrade cycle you referred to in your prepared comments ? What inning are we in , in your mind ? How much of an ASP lift can that give you ?

So first , I 'd say in our -- obviously , we 're well into Skylake , but the transition now is into Cascade Lake , and that 's a higher performance SKU . In the quarter , the high ASPs were really driven by particularly cloud customers really moving to the highest end product within the Cascade Lake family . So we 're seeing the transition from Skylake to Cascade Lake , and within Cascade Lake , real high-performance SKU that 's our highest performance ASP . So that mix dynamic in Q3 , I do n't expect that to stay where it is . I think we 'll go to more of a balance as we 're into Q4 next year . In terms of competitive dynamics , I would just say that we got a great lineup of products . We got Skylake to Cascade Lake . First half to next year , we 're looking at Cooper Lake . As we talked before , we 're really excited about Ice Lake server coming out in the second half of next year .

From the last 2 years , I think , as you know , we 've spent over $ 30 billion in CapEx to both have more capacity for 14 while we also begin to ramp 10 . In my prepared comments , I said we added 25 % wafer start capacity 2018 to 2019 . Our first half to second half unit volume will be up double digit , so we 're making good progress throughout the course of the year , but our expectations were in the second half we will be back in a supply/demand equilibrium .

And for us , node transition next year is going to be -- 14-nanometer will be a little better in terms of its profitability . Yields wo n't be dramatically different because we 're extremely mature , but depreciation levels will be lower because a lot of these tools have been fully depreciated there because we 've been on that node for so long . But for the node transition , 14 will be a little bit better . Our expectation is 10-nanometer yields will continue to improve , but at the same time , the mix of 10 versus 14 will be a little bit of a wait . So node transition will work against us .

Those macro trends have been very attractive for the long -- for a while , and we expect those to continue . But to your point , the -- our experience with the cloud providers is they go through big buying cycles and then relatively long digestion periods . What we did experience last year was a gangbuster year , but it 's been 3 quarters coming into the third quarter where they went through digestions . And what we started to see in the third quarter was , particularly for high-performance compute , start to see them come back into the market to really begin to purchase a little bit more . So how long that cycle lasts is going to be a function of several variables , but their end demand seems to continue to be relatively strong . And therefore , the need to add capacity , we think , will follow their end demand given they 've been out of the market a little bit for about 3 quarters now up 'til Q3 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Oct-24", "chunk_index": 52, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-24-INTC.txt"}}

With the interim introduction , I thought on our outlook I was getting demoted already . But look , coming off a record 2018 , our top line results came in slightly higher than expectations , with upsides in the PC and IoT segments , offset by incremental NAND pricing weakness . Total revenue of $ 16.1 billion was flat year-over-year , as our PC-centric business grew 4 % and our data-centric businesses were down 5 % .

The team executed well , though underlying trends are concerning , and as a result , we 've revised our expectations down for the full year . I 'll give you some insight into the customer trends informing our outlook , but first , I 'd like to take a few minutes to recap the progress we 've made over the first quarter . It 's been just under 3 months since I was honored with the best job in the world . At that time , I said that our leadership team would focus relentlessly on delivering for our customers to take advantage of the biggest opportunity in our company 's history . We 're making important progress by intensifying our focus in 3 key areas : expanding our TAM , accelerating innovation and improving our execution while evolving our culture . I 'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our philosophy and progress in each of those areas . First , expanding our TAM . We are transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company , and our ambitions are bigger than they 've ever been . Our aim is to identify and capitalize on key technology inflections that set us up to play a larger role in our customers ' success while improving returns for our owners . You can see the impact of this approach in our Q1 execution . For example , our first-ever data-centric portfolio launch marked an important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and undisputed technology inflection . Our new second-generation Xeon Scalable is the only processor in the industry with built-in", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Apr-25", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-25-INTC.txt"}}

For example , our first-ever data-centric portfolio launch marked an important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and undisputed technology inflection . Our new second-generation Xeon Scalable is the only processor in the industry with built-in artificial intelligence acceleration . Not only did we deliver a 14x generation-over-generation performance improvement , but we also showed CPU performance beating GPU performance on major AI workloads like recommendation engines . And we worked closely with the software industry ahead of the launch to deliver a great out-of-the-box experience for customers like Siemens . They 're collaborating with us on a breakthrough AI-based cardiac MRI model . This application has the potential to provide real-time diagnosis using the DL Boost technology in our newest Xeon Scalable processor . Another TAM-expanding business that continues to gain traction is Mobileye , with 8 new global ADAS designs in the first quarter alone , including our first win in India . Mobileye 's real-time crowd-sourced mapping technology , Road Experience Management or REM , continues to build momentum with a major North American automaker adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability . Autonomous driving is a technology inflection that we 're ready to lead . 2019 will be a foundational year for another disruptive technology , 5G . As you know , we recently sharpened our 5G focus . When it became apparent that we do n't have a clear path to profitability in 5G smartphone modems , we acted . We are now winding down that business and conducting a strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while continuing to meet our current 4G customer commitments .

We are now winding down that business and conducting a strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while continuing to meet our current 4G customer commitments . By acting now , we focus our 5G efforts on the transformation of the wireless network and edge infrastructure , where we have a clear technology advantage , market share to win and a strategic role to play with customers . At Mobile World Congress , we demonstrated a range of 5G products under development , including the 5G-ready N3000 FPGA acceleration card and the new 10-nanometer-based Snow Ridge network SoC for use in 5G base stations . As networks cloudify , Intel is in a great position to win in this base station segment , where we expect to grow to 40 % market segment share by 2022 . The vast majority of the 5G market opportunity and profit is in the transformation of network and edge infrastructure , where we are now laser focused . Next , accelerating innovation . Successfully competing in a bigger TAM requires a broad range of products and technologies . Only Intel has the breadth of IP to deliver leadership products across increasingly diverse workloads for the data-centric era . Harnessing data for discovery , invention and business value is not a one-size-fits-all computing challenge . That 's why we are investing in 6 important pillars of innovation : process technology , architecture , memory , interconnect , security features and software . Already this year , we 've introduced incredible examples of this approach to innovation across the business . Let me take a minute to talk about a few .

Already this year , we 've introduced incredible examples of this approach to innovation across the business . Let me take a minute to talk about a few . We are currently architecting what we expect will be the United States ' first exascale supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory . This supercomputer , called Aurora , will be delivered in 2021 and powered by Intel technologies designed specifically for the convergence of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing . These include a future generation of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor , Intel 's Xe compute architecture , a future generation of Optane persistent memory and Intel 's One API software . It 's a great example of how our data-centric products architected together can deliver technology breakthroughs for our customers . We are also accelerating innovation in our PC-centric business . For example , our team is hard at work with our OEM customers to define and deliver a stunning new class of next-generation laptops . We call this Project Athena , and the first of these sleek , beautiful designs are coming in the second half of 2019 . And just this week , we launched the most powerful generation of Intel Core mobile processors ever , designed for gamers and content creators . On the process technology front , our teams executed well in Q1 and our velocity is increasing . We remain on track to have volume client systems on shelves for the holiday selling season . And over the past 4 months , the organization drove a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at which 10-nanometer products moved through our factories . Finally , execution and culture .

This is about concentrating our resources on the vital few programs that will have an impact on our customers ' success and our owners ' return , rather than the trivial many . Over the last couple of years , that focus has resulted in exiting McAfee and wearables business , shutting down Saffron and divesting Wind River . And our spending as a percentage of revenue has gone from approximately 36 % to about 30 % this quarter . It has allowed us to invest more of our resources , and just as importantly , our collective attention and focus , where it really counts . By doing fewer things , we 'll execute better at the things that matter most . Specific areas where we need to improve execution include meeting customer demand and delivering on our 10-nanometer lineup of products , and we are making progress . Our supply constraints have had a disruptive impact on our customers and ecosystem . We 've committed never again to be a constraint on our customers ' growth . We 've increased capacity to improve our position in the second half , although product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams align available supply with customer demand . As I shared earlier , our confidence in 10-nanometer is also improving .

I 'll shift now to our full year outlook . Going forward , George will deliver our forecast . But given this is his third week with us , I 'll share my thoughts on our full year reset and he 'll review our first quarter results and second quarter guide . Our conversations with customers and partners across our PC and data-centric businesses over the past couple of months have made several trends clear . The decline in memory pricing has intensified . The data center inventory and capacity digestion that we described in January is more pronounced than we expected , and China headwinds have increased , leading to a more cautious IT spending environment . And yet those same customer conversations reinforce our confidence that demand will improve in the second half . So we 've reassessed our '19 expectations based on the challenges we 're seeing . Our full year outlook is now $ 69 billion in revenue , down 3 % year-over-year and down approximately $ 2.5 billion from our previous estimate . Given the magnitude of change , we 'll be somewhat more granular in explaining the drivers . We now see data-centric revenue down low single digits year-over-year , with DCG down mid-single digits year-over-year off a tough compare , continued China weakness and inventory and capacity absorption . We are also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing environment .

We are also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing environment . Our PC-centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits . We are forecasting operating margin to be 32 % , down approximately 3 points year-over-year and down approximately 2 points from our previous guide . This outlook reflects lower full year revenue and a year-over-year decline in gross margins as a result of the 10-nanometer ramp and NAND pricing . We continue to see good discipline on spending and expect our exit from the 5G smartphone modem segment , annualized in 2018 spending actions , and incremental spending efficiencies to reduce OpEx by approximately $ 1 billion year-over-year , partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margin . We now forecast full year EPS at $ 4.35 per share , down approximately 5 % year-over-year and $ 0.25 from our previous guide . We now expect our full year tax rate to be 12 % , up 1 point year-over-year and down 1.5 points versus our prior guide , largely as a result of lower pretax income .

I 'm delighted to be at Intel and look forward to regularly engaging with our key stakeholders . Revenue for our first quarter came in at $ 16.1 billion , flat year-on-year and slightly higher than our guide . Data-centric revenue was $ 7.5 billion , down 5 % ; and PC-centric revenue was $ 8.6 billion , up 4 % year-on-year . Q1 operating margin was 28 % , down 2 points due to cost of our 10-nanometer ramp and NAND reserves , partially offset by platform ASP strength as supply constraints at the low end in CCG led to an especially rich mix as well as lower spending overall .

Year-to-date , we have generated $ 1.6 billion of free cash flow ; returned $ 3.9 billion to shareholders , including dividends of $ 1.4 billion ; and repurchased approximately 49 million shares . We are pleased with the team 's focused execution for the quarter . We anticipated a challenging start to 2019 , and that 's what we have encountered . We also knew that the timing of our 10-nanometer ramp would pressure margins in the first quarter . And while we continue to make progress on the road map , that pressure remains a factor . We see customers becoming more cautious in their buying patterns , with the most acute deceleration happening in China . Demand pressure is particularly evident in our data center business , where we are seeing a continuing inventory correction in enterprise and comms and capacity digestion among cloud service providers who ramped consumption strongly in 2018 . Non-GAAP EPS was up 2 % year-over-year driven by strength in our client and IoT ASPs , lower spending , lower shares outstanding and the McAfee dividend received in the quarter . Offsetting factors were continued NAND pricing pressure , 10-nanometer ramp cost and weak enterprise and government data center demand . Our tax rate came in at 12.5 % , up almost 1 point year-over-year due to nonrecurring benefits in Q1 of 2018 . We continue to improve our operating efficiency year-over-year from 32.4 % to 30.3 % spending as a percent of revenue .

Within that overall flat R & D spend , we are making thoughtful trade-offs so that we can amplify the investments into key priorities to grow the business . This has resulted in more investment in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer process technology and accelerating road maps in DCG and CCG and in key growth areas like autonomous driving , AI and 5G network infrastructure . Let me now break down our performance by segment . Our Data Center Group ended the quarter with revenue of $ 4.9 billion , down 6 % from the prior year and 19 % sequentially within our expected range of sequential decline , given the headwinds we noted last quarter . Against the challenging year-over-year compare , platform units were down 8 % . We saw record Xeon ASPs as customers continue to select high-performance products . We also saw a strong ramp of network SoCs , resulting in moderation of our blended platform ASP . Non-CPU adjacencies were up 2 % driven by strength in network ASICs and silicon photonics . Cloud revenue grew 5 % year-over-year in the first quarter as cloud service providers absorbed capacity put in place in 2018 . Enterprise and government revenue declined by 21 % , and comms service provider revenue declined 4 % year-over-year in the", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2019-Apr-25", "chunk_index": 13, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-25-INTC.txt"}}

Overall , our data-centric businesses were flat year-over-year . Our IoT businesses saw 19 % revenue growth adjusted for Wind River and operating income growth of 11 % year-on-year due to a mix shift to higher core products in the quarter , with the growth of compute-intensive applications like AI and computer vision . Mobileye had record revenue , up 38 % due to an extended -- expanded product portfolio and customer base . Our memory business was down 12 % due to continued NAND pricing pressures , offset by NAND data center and client bit growth . Operating income for this group is down driven by NAND ASP deterioration and demand softness , resulting in inventory revaluations . The PSG group declined 2 % year-on-year due to weakness in cloud and enterprise , partially offset by strength in wireless and advanced node products . The Client Computing Group showed continued growth , with revenue up 4 % year-over-year . Platform revenue was up 3 % driven by strength in large commercial and gaming . Modem drove the majority of strength in the adjacencies , resulting in a 26 % increase over the prior year .

We have added supply capacity and continue working closely with our customers to align our available supply to their demand .

We saw strong ASP growth in desktop and notebook in part due to the small core constraints , but also on strong performance in gaming . Constraints were also responsible for the year-over-year decline in volume . This quarter , we generated $ 5 billion in operating cash flow , and we invested $ 3.3 billion to expand our 14-nanometer capacity and ramp 10-nanometer . We raised the dividend by 5 % and repurchased 49 million shares . Let me wrap up with our Q2 outlook . We expect Q2 revenue to be $ 15.6 billion , down 8 % year-over-year . Our data-centric businesses are expected to decline in the high single digits year-over-year as memory pricing declines weigh on our NAND business and DCG customers continue to consume inventory and absorb capacity . We expect DCG to be approximately flat sequentially . The PC-centric segment is expected to decline in the high single digits on declining PC ASPs on a relative mix of more small core units . Operating margin in Q2 is expected to be 29 % , down 4 points year-over-year on lower platform revenue , the 4G modem ramp and NAND pricing .

I 'd start by saying implied in our guide for the first half is roughly 60 % , so it implies a little increase off of Q1 . And our implied guide then for full year is almost 60 % . So through all the ups and downs , there 's going to be quite a bit of consistency . That being said , the Q1 will likely be the lowest , because as I indicated in my prepared remarks , that we 're going to -- we intend to qualify the 10-nanometer part in the second quarter . So what that means is in the first quarter , all of our 10-nanometer cost is flowing through cost of sales . When we qualify , it goes on the balance sheet . And then when we sell those previously reserved units in the third quarter , those units go out with no cost . So the dynamics imply low Q1 and a much stronger Q3 , but through it all , fairly stable at roughly 60 % level . On the year-on-year decline , obviously , the NSD -- sorry , NSG pricing is having a real impact on us .

But the one we planned for is just as we ramp 10 , and as you 're aware and I mentioned earlier , until we qualify the product , which we expect to do in the second quarter , all that cost flows through cost of sales . So when we 're in early stages of ramp prior to qualification , that does compress gross margin . And that played out as we expected , because I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our progress and our improvement on 10-nanometer yields was in line with what we 've expected coming into the year , a little bit better , that gave us the comfort that we 're going to increase volume at the end of the year .

That cost us over 1 point of gross margins in the quarter . That we did not quite anticipate . So gross margin Q1 , in line with kind of what we thought , with the exception of inventory reserves that we took in the quarter .

And again , what we said is fast follow after client systems on shelf , so sometime in 2020 , earlier versus later . In terms of just competitive positioning , with the -- we 've been -- our Xeon Scalable product that we launched last year and then enhanced with our Cascade Lake launch just a few weeks ago I think , that has increased performance . It 's got AI acceleration built into it . It 's coupled with Optane memory . It 's got a 56 core count . And the performance of that product , coupled with our knowledge of the environment in which -- our customers ' environments , we think we really have demonstrated differentiated performance , a product leadership performance , even though it is still on 14-nanometer .

Our data-centric businesses were up 16 % year-over-year . Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results . And in Q2 , we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing , the data center and memory . With industry-leading products and a strong first half results , we 're on a clear path for another record year . As we shared in February and reinforced in April , our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries . I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy : growing the data center and adjacencies , ensuring a strong and healthy PC business , growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs . I 'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2 . First , DCG . The data center business grew 9 % in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year . Strong public cloud growth continued , with revenue up 35 % . Enterprise was down 11 % , as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment .

Comms service provider revenue was up 17 % , while adjacencies , which serve all customer segments , rose 12 % . Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60 % of our DCG revenue . In 5G , we 're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure . We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline . And we 're on track with our development of IA , FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards . Earlier this month , we launched Xeon Scalable , formerly known as Skylake , and with it the industry 's biggest platform advancement in a decade . Using Xeon Scalable , our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads . For example , the new AVX-512 instructions , double floating point performance , benefiting use cases like HPC , VR and AI . In fact , artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization , customers , like Amazon Web Services , are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x . The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever . We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership .

By 2021 , we expect the data center to be a $ 65 billion silicon opportunity , and we 're less than 40 % of the total available segment today . As we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet , silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design , we 'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM . The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result . Revenue was up 12 % over last year , as product leadership , combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy , led to rising core mix . We , along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain , are driving the evolution of the PC experience , as users seek out high performance and new form factors . We launched a powerful , new Intel Core X-Series processor family , including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor , extending our performance leadership . And we 'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer product near the end of the year , beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018 .

As I mentioned earlier , we 're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem laying the groundwork for 5G . And starting in 2018 , Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic Games . In our Internet of Things business , we 're focused on 4 key verticals : retail , video , industrial and transportation . We saw strong growth across all 4 , leading to a 26 % increase in revenue . We 're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota . We 're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation . We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter , several months earlier than expected . Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives , and we are investing to win in this important segment . I 'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel . Together , we expect to be the global leader in the $ 70 billion autonomous driving system , data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost .

Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year . Our memory business grew 58 % over last year , setting an all-time revenue record . A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology . And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry 's first and to date only 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs . Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers . And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64 . We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients , which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners , and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently , which will ship for revenue this year . Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year . Our memory factory , Fab 68 , continues to exceed expectations , ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield . This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half , which we expect to be greater than 20 % .

Lastly , our FPGA business was down 5 % over last year on weaker data center and comp sectors but remain on track to our mid-single-digit growth target for the full year with broad re-acceleration in the second half across markets , including the data center segment . At their Build Conference in May , Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs , resulting in the industry 's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks . Audi selected Intel for the level 3 autonomous driving systems in its upcoming A8 , where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data preprocessing . We 're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs . We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments , and we 're on track to production later this year . To sum it up , I 'm very pleased with our progress , and I 'm more confident than ever in Intel 's future and growth .

Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12 % . Our data-centric businesses are more than 40 % of the company 's overall revenue . Moving to earnings . We are seeing broad growth across the business , driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22 % EPS growth year-over-year . Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses , improving unit cost with 14-nanometer ramp and gains from the sale of a portion of our equity investments in ASML . On our Q1 earnings call , Brian and I talked about our commitment to achieving spending target of approximately 30 % of revenue no later than 2020 . We 've made great progress in the second quarter , as total spending was down 330 basis points year-over-year . We 've continued investments in our key priorities , including artificial intelligence , autonomous driving and Moore 's Law , while at the same time capturing benefits of our previously announced restructuring program and significant leverage from strong top line growth .

You 'll see us continue to raise that operating margin so that we 're back at the 40-plus-percent operating margin for the back half and for the year . First , kind of want to kind of lay that groundwork . What we 've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line . We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline . It declined a bit more in the second quarter than -- I think we had really projected a decline at about 11 % . But if you look at Q1 , it declined a little less than we expected at 3 % , but we still expect it to decline in those high single-digit numbers . Cloud though grew greater than what we expected at 36 % . We expect it to be in the mid-20s , probably more likely . And then data center -- I mean networking and comms , 17 % . Adjacencies at 12 % . So we expect that trend to continue . We do n't need any big shift in those trends to really get to that high single-digit growth rate for the data center . We talked about Xeon Scalable .

When we talk about for next year , that 's inclusive of 3D XPoint . And so the difference is really as we ramp products on 3D XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68 , both of those -- whenever you 're ramping a factory , you always -- because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going , you tend to have slightly higher cost .

So it 's 64-tier products on traditional NAND , the ramp out of Fab 68 and then the real start-up and continuation and getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us everything profitable next year . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 7 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Ross Clark Seymore , Deutsche Bank AG , Research Division - MD [ 8 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Jul-27", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jul-27-INTC.txt"}}

The short answer is yes . The combination of the incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for the slightly higher spend . I would -- your initial comment on flow-through , to put it into context , from where we were in January , our full year outlook , the revenue is up roughly $ 1.8 billion . And with that $ 1.8 billion , there 'll be roughly $ 200 million of costs , primarily Mobileye . So in context , we feel like we 're managing the cost and spending side of the business effectively as we position to a 30 % spending of revenue by 2020 at the latest . In terms of the gross margin dynamics , I think the trends that you 've seen over the last couple of quarters we expect to continue through the year . And it 's really ASP improvements , good unit cost performance , volume leverage to the fab kind of working in our favor . And on the flip side , the strong growth of the memory and the modem business and the ramp cost for 10-nanometer are partial offsets .

So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center . We do sell into client as well , but that 's not the main focus of this business . And so I tell you that 's -- when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we 're investing in the future , that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but at the high-performance end . So we 're not going after commodity SSDs that you 're going to see even in higher-end workstations necessarily . It 's really focused towards the data center products .

Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook . And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations . Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3 % overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart , connected devices . We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation , as evidenced by results in the data center , IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter .

We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor , formerly known as Kaby Lake , and our latest LTE modem , known as 7360 . Next the Data Center , where revenue grew 5 % year over year . Cloud service providers grew 9 % , comm service providers grew 10 % , and enterprise was down 1 % . We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year . In the data center , we 're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack . Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment , from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end . We continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment , as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN , NFE , and 5G . The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1 % decline in data center CPU average selling prices .

Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator , formerly known as Knights Landing , continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year . Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015 , gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments . Omni-Path , our high performance computing fabric , was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30 % market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market . In June 's top 500 supercomputing list , Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems , pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market . This quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue , the industry 's only fully integrated solution . We expect DCG 's adjacent product lines , including Omni-Path , Silicon Photonics and ethernet , to collectively grow more than 20 % for the full year , and this quarter make up 12 % of DCG 's revenue . The Internet of Things business was up 2 % over last year , coming in below our expectations .

Our security business was up 10 % as a restructuring the team completed last year , and their focused execution continues to deliver results . And finally , our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track . This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing . In April we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing . These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart , connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business . In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $ 1.4 billion by mid-2017 . Looking ahead , I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year . While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits of this year , we 're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double digit growth in the third quarter .

Our net cash balance , total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer term investments , is negative $ 5.7 billion . We 're projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year . We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow , which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders .

One , we saw in the second quarter , and we project out into the second half , a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market . Enterprise side was down only about 1 % , which is a bit more stable than it has been . Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell E server in the second half of the year . So we expect strong demand . And we typically see an ASP uplift as people buy up in the stock with the new server systems coming out . And we have customers signals that just indicate that there is a second-half seasonal buying patterns kicking in a bit as well . Those three things are the second-half keys . If you take a look at a broader view of this , just overall our view of the Data Center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand . It 's going to be driven by the many , many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitudes more data than what the average human creates today , and that 's getting to the cloud .

In terms of the overall impact on financials , when I look at the second half , you will note that we have an above seasonal growth rate in there . The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the Data Center . So that 's kind of the biggest driver . We were kind of below the average annual growth rate in the first half . We expect to be above that low double digits in the back half driven by the three things he talked about that . But in particularly the cloud buying patterns that we 've identified with some of those large customers . And then behind that we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT .

Overall for the Company what we 're seeing , I 'll use Q3 as the anchor point , we are seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes . And then the big offset there is we are seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half . So that may be the piece that you are missing in the equation in Q3 . That continues into Q4 , by the way . We see a little bit more startup costs . If you do your algebra , you are probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that 's about 62 % . So think of that as some good things happen , but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalion costs with the first production of 3-D Cross Point that also kick in a bit more in Q4 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Ross Seymore , Deutsche Bank - Analyst [ 45 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Jul-20", "chunk_index": 41, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-20-INTC.txt"}}

It was the 14-nanometer cost of Broadwell server .

But the one thing I 'd point you to is remember , something like networking , which is at atom-based server product that 's going in . While it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG , it has an ASP that 's actually been going up and it has a very different cost structure than a Xeon does .

And one point I had predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year . The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out . So that will happen sometime in 2017 , although I do think we will make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half . Today our net debt level is right around $ 5 billion . So we will take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half . In terms of -- now that said , we 're still generating excess free cash flow . You can see that even in the first half , even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did . And so you can see we did , I think $ 1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half .

It 's going to be lumpy . These guys do n't build out their data centers in a linear fashion . They go , they build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go then sell that and have expansion space . And they do n't build for a while .

We are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourself with a better cost per performance model over time . And so we know that even if there was no competition , the competition is we 've got to build a product that 's better and drives replacement as well as growth . And so , I look at the competition as it 's welcome , it keeps us better , it 's always been out there . There will always be somebody out there .

Our results for the quarter were outstanding , marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018 . Last week , we celebrated Intel 's 50th year as a company , which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving . Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech , Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance . We set a course 5 years ago to transform the company .

To do that , we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets . Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world 's insatiable need to process , store and move data . The results have been dramatic . We are now competing for a $ 260 billion TAM , the largest in the company 's history , and we have lots of room to grow . Just 5 years ago , roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric . Today , nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate . Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable . In fact , 90 % of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years . But of that data , only 1 % has been analyzed , indicating massive untapped potential . I 'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel 's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results . First , in our data center business , our focus on the cloud , network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment . Customer preference for our highest performance products continued , with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50 % of our mix in the second quarter . Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services , artificial intelligence and data analytics .

Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services , artificial intelligence and data analytics . Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies ' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads . In the comms service providers segment , we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture . Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter . PSG again set a record for design win volumes , indicating customers ' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge . Earlier this month , we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC , which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers ' diverse time-to-market performance , cost and power needs . We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center . In Q2 , PSG 's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter . IoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance , but for solutions that drive business value . We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas .

We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas . Building on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future , Mobileye set another all-time revenue record . Customer momentum continued with several design wins , including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker . We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye 's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment . In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs , Baidu will also integrate Mobileye 's responsibility sensitive safety model , an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making , an industry imperative . Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record . We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities , high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology . We 've recently announced that we are in production on the industry 's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs . And at the same time , industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders , including CERN , Google , SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology . Unlike traditional DRAM , Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity , up to 3 terabytes per socket , along with affordability and persistence . Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy .

We 'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi . Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint , which , combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology , offer the best solution for today 's computing and storage needs . And finally , in client computing , our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial , enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results . Overall market conditions also continue to improve , and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011 . The commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability . At the same time , consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment , producing another outstanding quarter in gaming . These trends reflect the market 's demand for our highest performance products , resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG . We also began shipping the 7560 modem , Intel 's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem . Our industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results .

The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company . While there is no timetable , the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates , both internal and external , is well underway . Personally , and on behalf of Intel 's 100,000-plus employees , I 'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career . The investments he made set us on a course for transformation . Even more importantly , he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search . Our financial results in the second quarter show we 're doing just that . Let 's turn to the numbers . Revenue of $ 17 billion was up 15 % year-over-year , marking a second record quarter . We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG , IoTG and Mobileye . Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26 % . Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $ 1.04 , up 44 % year-on-year , even as we continue to invest for growth .

As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business , we are raising our full year revenue guide by $ 2 billion to $ 69.5 billion . We are also raising our EPS guide by $ 0.30 versus April to $ 4.15 , and the free cash flow guide by $ 0.5 billion to $ 15 billion .

Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters , with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate . Our PC-centric business was up 6 % on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments . Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth , up 44 % year-on-year . And our operating margin expanded $ 1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year . Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses , leading to higher volumes and ASPs , strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks .

This focused approach is producing results . Total Q2 spending came in at $ 5.1 billion , 30 % of revenue . Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities . Versus the second quarter of last year , we delivered $ 2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending . Let 's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment . The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $ 5.5 billion , up 27 % year-over-year and operating income of $ 2.7 billion , up 65 % . Q2 operating margin was 49 % , and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments , which now make up 2/3 of DCG revenue . Platform unit volume was up 14 % and ASPs were up 11 % . Non-CPU adjacencies grew 30 % over last year , yet another indicator that we are growing share in a larger data-centric TAM .

Our Internet of Things business achieved record volume and record revenue of $ 880 million , up 22 % year-over-year , driven by strength in retail and industrial , as I mentioned earlier . Operating profit was $ 243 million , up 75 % year-over-year on higher revenue and flat spending . We expect the Wind River divestiture , which closed in the second quarter , will have a negative impact to IoTG revenue of approximately $ 150 million in the second half of 2018 . Mobileye also had another strong double-digit growth in the quarter , up 37 % over last year on increasing ADAS adoption .

PSG 's revenue came in at $ 517 million , up 18 % in Q2 , primarily from strength in the data center business . PSG 's data center segment was up 140 % over last year . In the Advanced products category , our 28- , 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew 70 % . Operating profit was $ 101 million , up 4 % year-over-year . Finally , the Client Computing Group continued to execute on all fronts with another outstanding quarter , generating $ 8.7 billion of revenue , up 6 % . Operating margin percent was flat year-over-year as the customer preference for high-performance products drove a strong mix and higher ASPs , offset by 10-nanometer ramp costs .

Shifting gears to our full year outlook . Our strategy is working . Our products are winning and our investments in data center growth are paying off . We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $ 69.5 billion , up $ 2 billion versus our expectations in April . This represents a $ 4.5 billion increase versus the expectations we set in January . Product innovation , a strong global economy and U.S. tax reform are spurring CIO investment in IT infrastructure , leading to higher data center demand and a stronger PC TAM . We are seeing demand signals in supply feasibility to deliver on our revised expectations . Our biggest challenge in the second half will be meeting additional demand , and we are working intently with our customers and our factories to be prepared so we are not constraining our customers ' growth .

I think as we look at what we need to do in 10 nanometers , again , let me replay some of the data we shared on our April call . Recall that 10 nanometers strive for a very aggressive density improvement target beyond 14 nanometers , almost a 2.7x scaling . And really , the challenges that we 're facing on 10 nanometers is delivering on all the revolutionary modules that ultimately deliver on that program . And while there 's risk and a degree of delay in our time line on that where we 're very pleased with the resiliency of our 14-nanometer road map where in the last few years we 've delivered in excess of 70 % product performance improvement as we move through our 14-nanometer generation of products . So as we look at 2019 , across both client and data center space , we feel very good about the product competitiveness of our 14-nanometer program . And that , to some degree , is factoring into our timing of 10-nanometer and launching 10-nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are at a level that make it prime for volume production . So 14-nanometer , I think through the rest of this year and through 2019 , continues we believe to drive product leadership across all our portfolios in clients and server .", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Jul-26", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-26-INTC.txt"}}

And it 's also broad-based in terms of our product portfolio . Xeon Scalable , we launched about a year ago and it crossed over , getting close to crossing over at about 50 % of our volumes . So a lot of room still to go on Xeon Scalable as we look forward . And as I think about the product portfolio beyond Xeon Scalable , you might have seen this week at the Google Next show , Google talked about adopting the Optane persistent memory DIMM , so we have that product portfolio ahead of us in the second half . And then our next-generation Xeon will begin to ramp in the early part of '19 .

Thanks , Stacy . First , I think the first half to second half dynamics , we 're looking at an operating margin improvement by 1.5 to 2 points . So we see good solid op margin growth first half to second half . The dynamics are the gross margin , we expect to come down a bit and be more than offset by good volume leverage on a relatively stable spending base . So that trend of modest gross margin erosion more than offset by spending leverage driving op income improvement is the trend that you 've been seeing for the last 6 to 8 quarters , and we expect that to continue into the second half of the year . When you look at -- implied in our guide for Q4 , in particular , couple of things going on . One , accelerating growth of modem as we go through the second half of the year , accelerating growth of NSG or memory as we go through the second half of the year . A , we have n't assumed the continued strong ASP performance that we 've seen through the first half", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Jul-26", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-26-INTC.txt"}}

A , we have n't assumed the continued strong ASP performance that we 've seen through the first half . We hope that turns to be conservative , but we 'll see how that plays out . And then , lastly , to your point , and Murthy mentioned earlier , we 're ramping up 10-nanometer to improve the yield . So that 's going to weigh on gross margins for the fourth quarter as well . So all things equal , we feel good about op margin expansion . We 're up 500 basis points in the quarter . We 'll be up another couple of points first half to second half , but the gross margin dynamics will weigh on us in the fourth quarter and spending will more than offset it . As we go into 2019 , I think the way we 've been running the business for the last few years , we have dramatically expanded our TAM . And with that TAM , we see more and more opportunities to invest and grow , and that growth is driving improved earnings for the company . At the same time , some of that growth has lower gross margins . But that expanded TAM , the higher revenue growth on a very well-controlled spending base is expanding our op income dollars and our earnings per share .

This summer , we celebrated our 50th anniversary , and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history . Record quarterly revenue of $ 19.2 billion was up 19 % . Our operating margins expanded 5 points , and earnings per share of $ 1.40 was up 39 % . Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business . Our data center , client computing , Internet of Things , memory and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue . We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row . Before we get deeper into the financials , I 'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy , our products and our people . First , our strategy . We are growing share in a larger TAM , driving operating leverage while increasing our R & D investments and delivering attractive capital returns .

We are growing share in a larger TAM , driving operating leverage while increasing our R & D investments and delivering attractive capital returns . Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis , storage and sharing of data . We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution . And we 've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company while at the same time , delivering significant operating leverage and exiting noncore businesses . Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results . Demand in growth this year continue to exceed our expectations . Collectively , our data-centric businesses are up 22 % year-to-date , led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments . In both our data centric and PC businesses , our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers . We 've expanded beyond CPUs with memory , modems , FPGAs and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS , artificial intelligence and 5G communications . We acquired Mobileye , which has integrated Intel Architecture to produce the industry 's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms . Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy , moving Mobileye further up the value chain . The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve .

They 're developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs . This is most evident in computer vision applications , which cut across all of our IoT verticals . As a result , our opportunity has never been bigger . We are competing and winning share in a $ 300 billion TAM , transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process . We now expect full year revenue to grow more than $ 8.4 billion over 2017 . And in the first 9 months of the year , we have returned $ 12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or 112 % of free cash flow . We 've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business . After 7 years of decline , we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year , and we continue to gain share in modems . We 've focused our investments in the PC sector and the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most , the commercial , gaming and 2-in-1 segments . Second , our products . Our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers ' problems . We 're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers . One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences . We do that broadly with our OEMs .

One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences . We do that broadly with our OEMs . An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning , new HP Spectre Folio , a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop . We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel 's low-power display technology . This sort of innovation is impossible without Intel 's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design . We also launched the new 9th Gen Intel Core desktop processors , including the world 's best gaming processor . In our data-centric businesses , we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake . Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation , Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up and a revolutionary new technology , Optane DC persistent memory . And we 're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs . In fact , we 'll have 60 % more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation . We shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to Google , Microsoft and Alibaba , and we 're already receiving great feedback . Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPs using Xeon Scalable and Optane , a level they said they 've never seen with any other platform approach", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Oct-25", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Oct-25-INTC.txt"}}

Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses . Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speed-up and scale out across 7 data centers , delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly . Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement . Mobileye customer momentum continued with 8 new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers , bringing our 2018 design win total to 20 . Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SoCs in the third quarter , bringing lifetime total to more than 33 million units . While our current product lineup is compelling , our road map is even more exciting . We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer . Yields are improving , and we 're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season . The breadth of IP we 've assembled , combined with Intel 's design , software , packaging and manufacturing capability , gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry 's future .

Our memory business delivered record revenue of $ 1.1 billion , up 21 % year-over-year as we continue to redefine the storage paradigm with industry-leading , low-cost , high-density NAND SSDs and the revolutionary performance of Optane drives . We have now reached the crossover point with 50 % of our data center and client SSDs shifted to cost-effective , 64-layer 3D NAND , leading to rapidly improving cost per gigabyte . At the same time , as a result of pursuing 3D XPoint development independently and a tougher NAND pricing environment , we now expect NSG to be approximately breakeven for the full year . Micron recently announced their intent to call the IMFT factory . Our agreements with Micron ensure a reliable and cost-effective supply of 3D XPoint through at least 2020 .

Our teams have done -- in conjunction with our customers , our teams have done an outstanding job in the third quarter and we project into the fourth quarter . And that has enabled us to increase our revenue outlook for the year by $ 1.7 billion . But I think as we go into the fourth quarter , given the demand signals we continue to see across the business , we , in fact , will be constraining growth . Our focus has been prioritizing in conjunction with our customers , Xeon and Core processors . And therefore , by definition , the lower end of PC and the IoT business is being constrained .

It 's a great question . I think at the aggregate level , there 's what I 'd maybe characterize as some decent tailwinds as we go -- as we exit the year and then go into '19 but also some headwinds . The tailwinds , we 've -- as you know , we 've been talking about an expanded TAM where we play a bigger and bigger role in the increased needs for data . And that larger TAM and the momentum we 're building across all of our products is a pretty good tailwind as we look at just demand for data , whether it 's with consumers or with businesses going into the new year . That 's a tailwind . Secondly , Murthy mentioned a few of the products that we have coming in down the pipe in fourth quarter and going in the next year . And those products , we believe , will deliver more and more performance for our clients , which I 'd characterize as a tailwind . And then third in somewhat of a perverse way , as you know , when PC was 70 % of the business and when enterprise was 50-plus percent of the data center business and those were declining , it was the headwind", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Oct-25", "chunk_index": 31, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Oct-25-INTC.txt"}}

But those more recently have been stable . So whether it 's our expanded TAM , our new products or the mix of our business , we have some tailwinds as we think about 2019 . At the same time , to your point , there 's some headwinds . And the headwinds , first , this has been a fantastic year for us and I think for the industry , and that just makes comps a little bit tougher as we go into next year . Second , we have growing competition . And growing competition can be a headwind for us . And our expectations are we 'll deal with that pretty effectively . And third , just global trade . In particular , as you know , China 's a big market for us . We got some important customers there , and it 's important -- it 's an important part of our global supply chain . So as that -- as this most recent round of tariffs kind of play out and we 're doing a lot of work with our customers to ensure that the global supply chain can be adjusted and adapted to deal with any tariffs that come down the way , but it 's -- I think it 's going to be a wait-and-see as we go into 2019 .

First , a little color on Q3 , and then I 'll walk from Q3 to Q4 dynamics . Yes , it 's as the -- we highlighted in the materials , 60 % -- almost 66 % gross margin in the quarter is high as it 's been for a very long time . And it was a function of a few things : One , continued volume leverage with full factories ; two , ASPs , both on a client side and on the data center side . And those were partially offset by platform cost going up and a change in mix , a growth of our modem and memory business . So those are the 4 dynamics that played out during the course of the quarter . I would say 66 % was artificially high , and I 'd say that for a couple of reasons .

I would say 66 % was artificially high , and I 'd say that for a couple of reasons . One , we had in our -- in the NSG business , we earned a government incentive that was from scaling our fabs outside the U.S . So that incentive was worth about $ 110 million . So a bit of a one-timer that we do n't expect to repeat itself . Secondly , sell-through of product , either -- on the CPU side , we 're working with our customers and shaping demand to where we had inventory . We had good sell-through for some inventory that was previously partially reserved . And then second , on our modem growth , our explosive modem growth in the quarter . We PRQ 'd that product in the third quarter . So we got the benefit of previously fully reserved inventory . So what all that means when you adjust for kind of one-timers , the 66 % is closer to 64 % in terms of normalized basis going into the fourth quarter . Our guide in the fourth quarter , to your question , is 62 % . So there 's really 3 dynamics that we see playing out in the fourth quarter . One , we expect ASPs to be better . And that 's going to be a little bit of a function of the prioritization of Xeon and Core processors , which are higher ASP mix . So we expect that to benefit us .

So we expect that to benefit us . But at the same time , there 's 3 other things that as we go into the fourth quarter that I 'd characterized as really good things but will have an impact on our gross margin . One is ramping 10-nanometer . We 're making good progress on 10-nanometer . Yields are improving , and that 's giving us the confidence to , in effect , turn on more equipment and incur the depreciation cost associated with that . So that will impact our Q3 to Q4 gross margins . And it 's a function of the progress we 're making on 10-nanometer . Second , memory continues to grow , a good 21 % growth in the third quarter . We expect it to continue to grow in the fourth quarter . And that has -- our NAND business has been profitable during the course of the year but not at the gross margins of our logic business . And then third , we 're experiencing explosive growth on modem with some really good share gains . And the modem product is also -- the combination of memory and modem are accretive to our year-on-year earnings growth but dilutive to our gross margins . So that 's the kind of Q3 adjusted gross margin going into Q4 will likely cost us roughly a couple points . As we then step back and think about 2019 , those -- we see those same dynamics playing out , primarily 14-nanometer volume . So continued good yield , unit cost performance on 14-nanometer .

And we do expect to continue to grow memory and modem . It 'll be accretive to earnings but a little dilutive to gross margin . So again , a fairly long-winded walk from what drove Q3 . The goodness operationally of what will happen to Q4 gross margins has been our comfort that 2019 will be a modest degradation . But when coupled with the leverage on our operating expense , our operating margins will be kind of roughly flat in the 34 % range . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mark H.

I 'll review our results with you in just a moment , but before I do that , I 'd like to share a few words about security . We 've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown . While we 've made progress , I am acutely aware that we have more to do . We 've committed to being transparent , keeping our customers and owners appraised ( sic ) [ apprised ] of our progress and , through our actions , building trust . Security is a top priority for Intel , foundational to our products , and it 's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy . Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers ' infrastructure on these exploits . We 're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware , and those products will begin appearing later this year . However , these circumstances are highly dynamic , and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenge more broadly . Security has always been a priority for us , and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world 's most secure products .

To keep you informed , we 've created a dedicated website and we 're approaching this work with customer-first urgency . I 've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this , and we 're making progress . With that , let 's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results . We just wrapped up the best year in Intel 's history with the best quarter in Intel 's history . Revenue was up 4 % year-over-year in the fourth quarter , 8 % if you exclude McAfee , setting an all-time record . Our data center , IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue records . We met or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year , and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produced significant leverage , driving non-GAAP operating income up 21 % . Our data-centric businesses delivered the technology foundations for the new data economy , making the analysis , storage and transfer of data possible , giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights .

Data-centric revenue , excluding McAfee , was up an impressive 21 % over the fourth quarter of last year , and I 'd like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG . DCG 's revenue was up 20 % over the fourth quarter . The cloud segment was up 35 % , comm service providers were up 16 % , enterprise was up 11 % , and our adjacency revenue was up 35 % . We saw broad-based demand strength with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASP mix . Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher-performance products . In the comms service provider segment , we continued to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks . Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transitioned to Xeon Scalable products in a seasonally strong fourth quarter IT buying window . While we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to the public cloud , we are also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise buildouts . Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment on Xeon Scalable processors , which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition . We continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center , the edge and some hundreds of watts to milliwatts . Our software optimizations for the Caffe framework has improved already strong , beyond scalable ResNet-50 inference performance by 2x just since the launch in July .

The first-generation Nervana neural network processor ran a neural network less than 2 weeks after we received silicon , and we 've shipped our first customer units . At the edge , Google announced its AIY Vision Kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit , and Amazon announced DeepLens , the world 's first deep learning-enabled video camera for developers , which uses an Intel CPU , graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks . We 're also seeing design wins that combine technologies from multiple data-centric business units , reinforcing the idea that we have developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than any one business could alone . A great example is Dahua 's recent announcement of their Deep Sense product line , which combines Core CPU , Intel FPGA-based network video recorders , along with Movidius VPU-based cameras , to enable people and automobile detection and smart city application using artificial intelligence . In the Programmable Solutions Group , we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center , auto , embedded and advanced products categories as well as last-time buys of legacy products . That strength was partially offset by softness in comms infrastructure . In Q4 , we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that dramatically increased productivity for our customers .

Our Internet of Things Group grew 21 % with continuing momentum in retail , video and in-vehicle infotainment verticals . Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its profitable quarter ever for Intel . The memory business grew 9 % and achieved profitability in Q4 as strong client volume was partially offset by a 1-quarter qualification delay of a data center 's SSD volumes . Last quarter , I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangements . That interest has continued to grow . We have since signed additional agreements and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $ 2 billion over the course of 2018 . Mobileye had another strong quarter , and business momentum is growing . Our 30 design wins over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases of 2.5x over the prior period . We now have Level 2-plus and Level 3 design wins with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50 % of global vehicle production .

EyeQ5 will deliver 24 tera ops of deep learning performance in a 10-watt power envelope , or about 2.5x the efficiency of the competition . Just a couple of weeks ago at CES , we announced that , by the end of 2018 , we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowdsourced data for REM , our Road Experience Management mapping solution .

The ability to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update the precision maps required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system . It 's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work . And finally , I 'd like to touch on our PC-centric businesses , the Client Computing Group .

The fourth quarter was an outstanding close to a record 2017 , and we are building real momentum heading into 2018 . Revenue for the quarter was $ 17.1 billion , up 8 % year-over-year ; operating income was $ 5.9 billion , up 21 % year-over-year ; and EPS of $ 1.08 cents was up 37 % year-over-year . From a capital allocation perspective , we redeemed $ 1.6 billion of 2035 convertible debt , reducing our share count by 59 million shares , and repurchased $ 500 million of higher-coupon debt and exchanged $ 1.8 billion into 30-year debt at a 1 % lower coupon rate . On tax reform , our Q4 GAAP earnings reflect a onetime tax impact of $ 5.4 billion , and our guidance reflects approximately 7-point improvement in our effective tax rate going forward . To summarize , we had a fantastic quarter and year and are on track to exceed the 3-year targets we laid out at our Analyst Day , 1 full year ahead of schedule . Our Q4 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric to a data-centric company .

This business generated the cash to fund Intel 's investments in new data center growth . Moving to Q4 earnings . We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter , up 37 % year-on-year . Our EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth , a 5-point improvement in operating margins and significant gains from our ICAP Portfolio . Our gross margins expanded 2 points in the quarter , and our spending as a percent of revenue declined by 3 points as we delivered $ 700 million more revenue and $ 300 million less spending . In terms of operating efficiency , we 're well ahead of schedule of meeting our commitment by reducing spending to 30 % by 2020 . We now expect to achieve this goal no later than 2019 .

The Stratix 10 design win pipeline , which represents PSG 's largest ever , doubled over the last year due to engagements in 5G , cloud computing and the infrastructure transition to network function virtualization . We laid out our capital allocation priorities early in the year : invest organically , expand acquisitively and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely . In the year , we delivered on our promise . First , we generated strong free cash flow of $ 10.3 billion in the year and returned $ 8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends of $ 5.1 billion and share repurchases of $ 3.6 billion . Second , we funded a majority of the Mobileye acquisition from the sale of noncore assets during the year , including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares . And third , we redeemed $ 1.6 billion in convertible debt , reducing 59 million shares , and we also tendered higher-coupon debt for lower-coupon debt .

First , we sold 11.4 million shares of our ASML holding , which generated $ 2 billion in cash proceeds and a gain of $ 1.5 billion . Second , we redeemed our 2035 convertible debenture . This redemption created a $ 2.8 billion cash outflow and a noncash loss of $ 385 million , which was tax-deductible .

We also redeemed $ 425 million of old debt for cash . This transaction both lowered our leverage and our interest expense . Adding it all up , 2017 was another record year for Intel . Revenue of $ 62.8 billion was up 9 % year-over-year , driven by 16 % growth in our data-centric businesses and 3 % growth in PC-centric business . Operating income of $ 19.6 billion was up 18 % on strong execution across the businesses and disciplined spending . Earnings per share of $ 3.46 was up 28 % on excellent operational performance and the benefit of $ 0.35 from ICAP net gains . With the change to the accounting rules for recognizing price changes on equity investments , we do not expect to see these ICAP gains repeat . Before I turn to guidance , let me provide a little more context on the impact of tax reform on our business .

{"id": "INTC_2018-Jan-25_300_17", "text": "income tax expense of $ 5.4 billion as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December . This includes a onetime required tax adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings , payable over 8 years , which was partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income taxes for the new U.S. statutory tax rate . Looking ahead , we expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers like Intel that compete in today 's global economy . We expect a 2018 tax rate of approximately 14 % , driven by a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 % , lower tax on foreign income , benefits from U.S. exporters and the continuation of the R & D credit . The change in our tax rate drives approximately $ 0.28 in 2018 EPS . Intel has a rich history of investing in U.S.-led research and development and U.S. manufacturing . Just last year , we committed to the fit-up of our Fab 42 facility , creating thousands of jobs at completion . These tax reforms provide further incentive to continue investments like this . Before we turn to our 2018 outlook , I also want to highlight 2 accounting rule changes : first , new accounting rules for revenue recognition ; and second , accounting for equity gains and losses .

At the midpoint , down about 12 % sequentially is a lot worse than , I guess , normal seasonal . And I guess I 'm trying to figure out kind of the parameters that you guys are using to come up with that number . Was there something in the DCG strength in the calendar fourth quarter that you do n't think is repeatable ? Given your comments around the PC supply chain being healthy , that to me feels a little bit more seasonal than not in the March quarter . So I 'm just kind of curious as to why Q1 revenue would be so much below what has been kind of the 5-year median seasonality for Q1 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert H.

That 's number one . Number two , PSG 's 35 % growth was helped by end-of-life sales during the course of the quarter .

So question is are you seeing any competition ? Are you factoring that in ?

But I 'd start first with we 've always characterized our long-term gross margins to be in the 55 % to 65 % range . And for the last several years , and included in our guidance this year , we 'll be at the upper end of that 60 % to 65 % range . But for the last couple of years , there 's -- we 've had maturity of 14-nanometer . And that maturity , both in terms of getting more and more performance and lower and lower unit costs , has been contributors to gross margin . As we go into '18 , we see 14-nanometer modest contribution from profitability because we 've matured on the cost curve . That 's an increasingly competitive environment , and we do n't anticipate dramatic ASP improvements over the entire company . In some cases , yes , but for the most part , no . So we 'll see some continued improvement in 14-nanometer products during the course of the year . Secondly , we are really accelerating the growth of our adjacent businesses . The investments that we 've been making in both the data-centric businesses and our growth in modem , those are contributing to our year-on-year EPS growth .

However , those -- both of those product lines or businesses have lower margins . So our success in modem and memory is having a mix impact on our gross margins . The third area is we 're going from 10-nanometer start-up , where our costs are coming down , to more the ramp to the 10-nanometer . And that ramp is going to weigh on the margins as we begin to develop production going into the second half of the year where we 're way up the curve on where our yields and costs are . So those are kind of the 3 things as we see it , and if I were to characterize , roughly plus 1 , roughly minus 2 , roughly minus 1 , rounding those . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian M.

Amid a very challenging environment , cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work , learn , stay connected and provide critical goods and services . Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $ 19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $ 1.23 in earnings per share . We exceeded our guidance by $ 1.2 billion on the top line and $ 0.13 on the bottom line . Our data-centric businesses grew 34 % and drove approximately 52 % of the company 's revenue , and our PC-centric businesses grew 7 % . I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge . COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world .

On each earnings call , I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities : accelerating the growth of the company , improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital . Let me give you a few thoughts on each . We 're transforming the company to accelerate growth . That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history . We 've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud , AI , 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge . We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer , including our homes , our cars , our cities , our hospitals , our factories and now even our schools . In this new world , our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU . It 's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers ' success . That diversity is one critical factor in driving today 's results . I 'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days . AI use cases are becoming pervasive , and we are embedding AI capability into all our products . Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value , scalability , built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership . This quarter , we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor , Cooper Lake , which is the first mainstream server CPU , bfloat16 support , which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy . Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2020-Jul-23", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jul-23-INTC.txt"}}

Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge . In Q2 , both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40 % year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated . Leading cloud service providers , including Alibaba , Baidu , Facebook and Tencent , announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services . Also this quarter , Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances , including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines . We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten 's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service . This service is the world 's first end-to-end , fully virtualized , cloud native mobile network , and it 's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core . Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities . The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $ 230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS , data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies . Since the last call , we acquired Moovit , a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company . Combining Mobileye 's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation .

Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs , representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units . We 're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases . This quarter , we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family , extending our leadership in gaming and business . The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz , making them the world 's fastest gaming processors ; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs . Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield , featuring our new Intel hybrid technology , which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability . We also continue to work on improving our execution . Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis .

We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20 % versus our January expectations . Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong . We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together , and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product , Tiger Lake . Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU , graphics and AI , and we 'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks . We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product , Ice Lake , for the end of the year . And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server . Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21 . Let me provide some updates on our technology road map . We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies .

Turning to our 7-nanometer technology . We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations . The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process , which , based on recent data , is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target . We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation . We 've root caused the issue , and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks . But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty . We 're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging . We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map . Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers , and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products .

Gross margin for the quarter was 55 % , slightly below expectations , on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products , which are margin dilutive relative to the company average , and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall , partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R & D related to 7-nanometer product timing . As a reminder , we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product . This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the $ 0 units in our initial sales of product , which will begin this quarter . Operating margin of 31 % in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin . Q2 EPS was $ 1.23 , $ 0.13 above our guide as stronger-than-expected operating results from notebook , memory and a richer mix of server products , along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios , offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item . In Q2 , we generated $ 11.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $ 3.4 billion in CapEx , with $ 7.7 billion of free cash flow up 92 % year-over-year . We returned $ 1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends .

Based on demand signals from our customers , we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3 , but we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business , particularly the desktop form factor , and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye . As a result , we expect total revenue of $ 18.2 billion , with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year . In Q3 , we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory drawdown , softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession .

We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single digits year-over-year . Following a very strong first half of the year , we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM .

And then related , on the financial side , what 's the CapEx and gross margin implications and even pricing implications if you stay on 10-nanometer longer next year ?

Thanks , Vivek . I mean , first , our primary focus is on ensuring that we 're delivering leadership -- an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner . So what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020 , 2021 , 2022 for both client and server . And we feel very good about that lineup . And our expectation on 10-nanometer , much like what we 're able to do on 14-nanometer , is to get another node of performance within that -- within 10-nanometer in and of itself . So we feel very good about our product road map through 2022 . That being said , as we think about that next-generation of products in late '22 and '23 and beyond , we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance . And our priorities in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology , so we capture the economic benefits of IDM . But the focus will be leadership products .

I mean , first , product schedule slippage of roughly 2 quarters , while process we expect now to be roughly 4 quarters . The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things : one , a buffer in our planning process between process and products to make sure that we do n't -- minimal disruption on customers because of process ; second , as I 've mentioned in the prepared remarks , die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside and , therefore , further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage . So that 's why we 've been able to be confident in a 6-month product ship slip , even though process was moving out 12 months . In terms of -- I think your second question was about we 've seen this movie before , maybe .

And we feel pretty good about the investments that we 've been making . And last year , we wrapped up our best year in the company 's history , entering 2020 . Obviously , this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts . But at the same time , we expect '20 to be the best year in our company 's history , our fifth record year in a row , delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected . So competitively , we feel stronger as we exit 2020 . Third point I 'd make is our execution has improved . Capacity and supply is in place . We 're ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio . We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned and we have a strong leadership -- a strong pipeline over the next several years . And we believe we can deliver another notable performance on 10-nanometer itself . Fourth point , at the same time , our 7-nanometer products will be delayed . We 've pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node . But along the way ,", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2020-Jul-23", "chunk_index": 49, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jul-23-INTC.txt"}}

Fourth point , at the same time , our 7-nanometer products will be delayed . We 've pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node . But along the way , we have taken steps on die disaggregation , advanced packaging , deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength , not as a sign of weakness , that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions on where is the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers . And we feel pretty good about where we are , though we 're not happy . I 'm not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance . But as we sit here today , 6 months through the year , our people are safe . We 're delivering for our customers . The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference . And next 90 days from now , we 'll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth . So thanks for joining us , and we 'll talk to you soon . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Trey Campbell , Intel Corporation - Head of IR [ 37 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2020-Jul-23", "chunk_index": 50, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jul-23-INTC.txt"}}

The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April , and our results demonstrated our customers ' preference for the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow , diversify and become increasingly complex . That need for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business . Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy . The world 's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process , store and move it faster and better . Customers want to work with partners who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges . Our data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations . Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs . While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year , we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half . Enterprise and government spending remains weak , however , particularly in China . PC demand continued to improve , particularly in the commercial segment . We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year . Strong demand for our highest-performing products and the productivity and TCO gains they deliver continues .

While small core supply improved , we were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second quarter . Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers supply chain and drove a pull-in of client CPU orders into the second quarter . We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. government 's revised entity list . After a thorough review , we were able to resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the net impact on the second quarter was limited . While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved , further tightening of export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business . As a result , we enter the second half of the year a little more cautious than we were 90 days ago . We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting where we outlined 3 major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow . First , we 're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company 's history , a nearly $ 300 billion TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers but of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads and devices . Second , we 're strengthening our product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation .

I 'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we 're making . I 'll start with expanding our opportunity and expanding our TAM . Over the last few years , we have dramatically expanded our served market while the PC market was declining . Our served market now is more than 5x larger and growing faster , and we have reallocated spending to expand our capabilities in higher-growth areas . We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside everything that processes , stores and moves data . Big bets in 5G , AI and autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation . In May , I outlined a disciplined framework for investing in and evaluating big bets as we expand into new markets . First , we 'll invest where we have an opportunity to lead major technology inflections . Second , our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our customers ' success . And finally , they must show a clear path to profitability and attractive returns . Network infrastructure , which is transforming as the industry transitions to 5G , is one of our most important areas of investment , and we are laser-focused on this opportunity . This business has grown at a 40 % CAGR since 2014 from just over $ 1 billion in revenue to more than $ 4 billion last year .

The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in the core network and at the edge as more data moves closer to where it is created . We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge , Intel 's 10-nanometer system-on-chip technology for 5G base stations early next year . We 've already announced that 2 large telecom equipment manufacturers have committed to this architecture , and we 're on track to 40 % share in this market segment by 2022 . While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria , the 5G smartphone opportunity does not . This is why we decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and conduct an analysis of our options for the remaining parts of that portfolio . Today , we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem business to Apple . This deal preserves Intel 's access to critical IP we have developed . It enables us to focus on the more profitable 5G network opportunity where we are growing and winning share . Another growth market we 're gaining share is the Internet of Things . We are using our architecture , accelerators and software assets combined with unmatched scale and partners to develop one of the industry 's fastest-growing IoT portfolios .

This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on . Our team 's work is producing outstanding results . In the second quarter , we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time . Here again , we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we serve with computer vision being an especially critical workload . Mobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity , autonomous driving . This business has grown at more than 30 % CAGR since we acquired them in 2017 . Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year , representing 11 million lifetime units . Nissan 's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO 's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye-based L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology . I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem . The progress we are making in Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy is extraordinary . Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track .

Several major auto OEMs , most recently Ford , are adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability . To understand the power of this data , consider this : 1.5 million kilometers is sent to the cloud daily from BMW production vehicles . With the data collected from just the last 4 weeks , Mobileye was able to automatically map 94 % of the German autobahn and motorway network . And the commercial opportunity for REM extends beyond real-time maps for vehicles . Since announcing the agreement earlier this year , Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors . Artificial intelligence is a $ 10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023 . And today , it 's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads . This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers , most recently Baidu , are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T. NNP-T will sample to customers later this year , expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures , including ASICs like NNPI , TPUs , GPUs and FPGAs . All unified by single programming model , One API . The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation .

For example , in the second quarter , we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos , a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments . These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role . We are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing , storing and moving it more efficiently . An essential part of the equation is interconnect technology , which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks . Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud . We closed the transaction this week , and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family . Our client computing customers can look forward to exciting new Intel products this year . In the second quarter , we launched a special edition of the world 's best gaming processor , the Core i9-9900KS .

While we are delivering on the present , we are also creating the future . Intel Labs is researching completely new architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing that promise incredible leaps in performance and power efficiency . Neuromorphic computing strives to emulate the neural structure and operation of the human brain , which could deliver big advancements in artificial intelligence by allowing computers to sense , learn and behave more naturally and efficiently . Just this month , we announced an 8 million neuron neuromorphic system comprising 64 Intel Loihi research chips that 's now available to the broader research community . Finally , we are evolving our culture and improving execution because our customers are counting on us . Our process technology road map continues to improve , and we 're making excellent progress on 10-nanometer . We began shipping Ice Lake client in the second quarter supporting systems on the shelf for the holiday selling season and expect to ship Agilex , our first 10-nanometer FPGA later this year . We now have 2 factories in full production on 10-nanometer . We are also on track to launch 7-nanometer in 2021 .

We had a solid Q2 with revenue coming in at $ 16.5 billion , down 3 % year-on-year and higher by $ 900 million compared to our guide . Data-centric revenue was $ 7.7 billion , down 7 % . And PC-centric revenue was $ 8.8 billion , up 1 % year-on-year . Our Q2 operating margin was 31 % , down 2 points as client ASP strength was more than offset by platform volume declines and continued NAND pricing degradation . Q2 earnings per share came in at $ 1.06 , up 2 % year-on-year and $ 0.17 over our guide for the quarter . Year-to-date , we have generated $ 5.7 billion of free cash flow , returned $ 8.4 billion to shareholders , paid dividends of $ 2.8 billion and repurchased approximately 117 million shares . As mentioned last quarter , we anticipated a more challenging year in 2019 coming off a large build-out of capacity in 2018 by DCG customers as well as the pricing dynamics in memory , which is largely playing out as expected .

As mentioned last quarter , we anticipated a more challenging year in 2019 coming off a large build-out of capacity in 2018 by DCG customers as well as the pricing dynamics in memory , which is largely playing out as expected . In light of these factors , I 'm pleased with our results and operating performance for the quarter . Non-GAAP EPS was up 2 % year-over-year driven by strength in our platform ASPs , lower 10-nanometer startup costs , lower operating expenses as well as lower shares outstanding and a McAfee dividend . Offsetting factors were data-centric demand softness , continued NAND pricing pressure and PC supply constraints impacting our ability to fulfill low-end PC demand . Our non-GAAP tax rate came in at around 12 % , in line with last year . Let 's now turn to segment performance . Our Data Center Group ended the quarter with revenue at $ 5 billion , down 10 % from the prior year and up 2 % sequentially . This was slightly ahead of our expectations with platform ASPs up 2 % year-on-year . Xeon ASPs were up double digits year-on-year on mix as our customers continue to select high-performance products . Against the tough year-over-year compare , platform units were down 12 % . Cloud revenue was down 1 % year-over-year as cloud service providers absorbed capacity after growing demand 40 % in 2018 . Enterprise and government revenue declined by 31 % with particular weakness in China , while communication service providers revenue increased 3 % year-over-year . We see comms service provider demand still in the early phase of a meaningful 5G-related build-out .

Our Internet of Things businesses , which include IoTG and Mobileye , continue to show growth and delivered record revenue up 22 % , excluding Wind River . IoTG showed strength across all segments with revenue growth of 23 % year-over-year , excluding Wind River , and operating income growth of 21 % on strong demand for higher-performance products in the quarter . We believe a portion of the revenue outperformance in IoTG is from tariff-related pull-ins . Our Mobileye revenue and operating margin were up year-over-year 16 % and 20 % , respectively , on continued ADAS penetration . Our memory business revenue was down 13 % as the industry supply surplus continued to feed a deteriorating NAND pricing environment . NSG operating income weakened by approximately $ 220 million year-over-year . PSG revenue declined 5 % year-over-year as softness in cloud and enterprise demand more than offset growth in 5G wireless . Advanced products , which includes those manufactured on 28-nanometer through 14-nanometer process nodes , grew 15 % year-on-year .

We believe the PC TAM grew slightly in Q2 led by our commercial PC demand . Our PC units were down 5 % as our small core supply was constrained and we could not fulfill all of our customer demand . We have made significant progress against our supply challenges , and we expect supply and demand to return to balance in the second half . That said , demand has been stronger than expected and product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams work to align available supply with demand . We saw strong ASPs in the quarter with notebook ASPs up 3 % year-over-year and desktop ASPs up 5 % . Operating margin for our client group was 42 % , up 5 points year-on-year on strong revenue and mix and lower cost of sales post qualification of our 10-nanometer Ice Lake client product . For the first 2 quarters , we generated $ 12.5 billion in operating cash flow and we invested $ 6.9 billion in capital to ramp 10-nanometer capacity and for 7-nanometer product development .

Buyback was accelerated in the second quarter where our average purchase price was $ 46.78 per share . We have $ 11.7 billion remaining on our Board authorization . Now let 's talk about the full year outlook . For the full year , the market dynamics reflected in our April guide remain largely in place although memory has continued to weaken relative to our expectations . Although we have seen a weaker first half in our data center business , we expect a better second half as demand from cloud and comms service providers improves and our second gen Xeon Scalable continues to ramp . We are increasing our revenue outlook for the full year by $ 500 million to $ 69.5 billion to reflect the outperformance in the second quarter somewhat offset by the effect of trade-related pull-ins and a weaker memory environment . We continue to expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be down low single digits for the full year . Our guidance for full year PC-centric business growth remains a low single-digit decline for the year , reflecting share loss in small core applications where we have been short supply longer than expected and demand has remained healthy . We expect to have additional small core supply in the second half , which should allow us to regain some of that lost share . Operating margin for the year is expected to be 32 % , flat to our previous guide . Full year expectations for gross margin are unchanged at approximately 60 % . We expect Q3 gross margins to be roughly in line with Q2 on strong flow-through of higher revenue offset by increased 10-nanometer cost as we ramp production .

We expect Q3 gross margins to be roughly in line with Q2 on strong flow-through of higher revenue offset by increased 10-nanometer cost as we ramp production . The cost increase in Q3 will be tempered as we will be selling through some of the previously reserved 10-nanometer in the quarter , and we see the benefit of a grant related to our NAND factory in China . We expect Q4 gross margin to be down 3 to 3.5 points sequentially as we continue to ramp 10-nanometer and will have sold through the previously reserved inventory and will also not see the benefit of the NAND grant . We are making great progress on 10-nanometer and expect to see continued yield improvement as we move into 2020 and work through the cost curve . Full year spending is expected to be down almost $ 1 billion year-on-year in line with our prior outlook adjusted for costs related to our acquisition of Barefoot Networks . We are now expecting 2019 savings from our modem exit to rise to approximately $ 400 million to $ 500 million from our earlier estimates of $ 200 million to $ 300 million . The increased savings are being offset by higher spending on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer processes and product R & D .

Turning to Q3 outlook . We expect revenue of $ 18 billion , up 9 % sequentially , which is within our normal seasonal range after adjusting for trade-related pull-ins in Q2 . Our data-centric and PC-centric businesses will be down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q3 against very challenging compares .

And our intentions are over the -- over that time frame to continue to grow our data-centric collection of businesses at or above market rates of growth .

So a 2-part question on the Data Center Group . I guess first and foremost , could you just discuss a little bit about the differences between the subsegments ? The cloud side was impressively strong in the quarter and it sounds like you think that 's going to continue . But the enterprise and government side , I know you said that was China specific , but that was exceedingly weak . Any more color on what 's going on on that enterprise side in the current quarter and probably of equal , if not greater importance , the second half looks like you still expect a really big ramp and potentially better than seasonal .

And our expectations have been and still are that cloud will get a little bit stronger as we go into the second half . And as George mentioned , comms has been low single digits as our customers begin to build up for the transition to 5G , so we expect that growth to probably materialize more as we go into the latter part of this year , but I think more in 2020 . Enterprise and government has been brutal through the first 6 months of the year . Q1 was really soft . Q2 was even softer . And while we do n't like it , it 's been pretty much in line with how we expected the first half and even the second half of the year to kind of play out . A couple of dynamics .

A couple of dynamics . You 'll remember last year was really strong for enterprise and government . Growth was much stronger than we expected . Our belief at the time is that that was largely a function of increased digital transformation by CIOs , a favorable tax reform environment that gave them a little more capacity to spend . And we benefited from that tremendously last year . So the first half of this year , even the second half comps -- our comps are much tougher . And I would say our sense is that CIOs , broadly speaking , are a little more cautious as they go into the second half of the year . And then when you just take -- that 's a broad-based comment . And then when you take China into account , China is even worse than that . So our thoughts through the first half of the year and even going into the second half of the year is the E & G environment wo n't get dramatically better . Cloud will get a little bit stronger and comms will get a little bit stronger in the context of our overall full year guide . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- George S.

I would also say though , you 're seeing a really pure impact of memory in the fourth quarter as well because they -- we have a grant in the third quarter .

We had a -- the quarter played out much stronger than we expected . Revenue better , gross margins better , spending in line , earnings greater . And therefore , from that confidence , we 're raising our full year outlook and kind of feel good about our performance 6 months through the year . Secondly and just more importantly , we continue to really work the supply chain so we 're never in a position to constrain our customers ' growth . We 've made good progress through the first half . But I think more as we go into the second half , we 're just in a better position than we 've been in a while . We still have work to do . We 're still working with our customers , but we feel pretty good on the supply as we enter the second half . And then third , our progress on both 10-nanometer and our confidence in migrating from 10 to 7 continues to grow based on execution . So we kind of gave you a 3-year outlook . We consider this the second deposit of that 12 deposit 3-year outlook , and I 'd say we feel pretty good about where we are . And we look forward to giving you another update 90 days from now about continued progress momentum on our multiyear journey .

The first quarter marked a great start to the year . Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016 , Q1 revenue was up 7 % over the first quarter of last year , a record Q1 . And operating margin was up 20 % . It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices . Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC , data center and IoT business , reflecting the market 's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy . And our memory business set an all-time record revenue . At our investor meeting in February , I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries . I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year : growing the data center and adjacencies ; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business ; growing IoT and devices ; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs . That 's the framework we 're using to measure our success throughout the year , and I 'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far .", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-INTC.txt"}}

That 's the framework we 're using to measure our success throughout the year , and I 'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far . First , the data center and its adjacencies . DCG grew 6 % year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year . The cloud service provider revenue was up 18 % . The comms service provider segment was up 12 % . And enterprise was down 3 % , while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20 % across all of the segments . Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line , underscoring the market 's demand for performance to transmit , aggregate and analyze data . We 're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor . Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads . For example , Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation , a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads . And last month , we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group , bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products .

Second , a strong and healthy client business . Our annual cadence of product innovation , combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy , continued to produce strong mix , which drove higher ASPs . This trend , along with our ramping modem business , drove revenue up 6 % and operating margin up 60 % over last year . Our expectations for the PC unit TAM have n't changed since we last talked with you . We 're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM . Our ASPs , however , are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year . Third , we 've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices . IOTG revenue was up 11 % year-over-year , where we saw strength in our industrial , video and automotive segments . We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye , a highly profitable , fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving . The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel 's expertise in high-performance computing , artificial intelligence and connectivity . Together , we expect to be the global leader in the $ 70 billion autonomous driving systems , data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost .

And finally , we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs . Our memory business grew 55 % year-over-year in a tight supply environment ; while Fab 68 , our Dalian factory , continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields . We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution , which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter . In our Programmable Solutions Group , revenue declined 7 % over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016 . The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment , partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer . We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud , the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group , for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service . We 're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals . We 're improving the profitability and health of our PC business .

We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30 % of revenue , which I expect to reach no later than 2020 . Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016 , we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017 , and we 're now expecting to do a little better than that . While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets , hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities .

We executed on several important milestones in the quarter . We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business . Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp . And Intel 's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group . Revenue was $ 14.8 billion , up 7 % year-over-year . Operating income was $ 3.9 billion , up 20 % year-over-year . And earnings per share of $ 0.66 was up 22 % year-over-year . Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion . First quarter operating margin was 27 % , up 3 points year-over-year , and gross margin came in at 63 % , up 0.5 point year-over-year .

Direct spending came in at $ 5.4 billion , flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program . Let me touch briefly on our segment performance . The Client Computing Group had revenue of $ 8 billion , up 6 % year-over-year . We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels . Client ASPs were up 7 % year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong . This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60 % from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost , richer product mix and lower spending , primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG & A allocations . The Data Center Group had revenue of $ 4.2 billion , up 6 % year-over-year . The Data Center Group had operating profit of $ 1.5 billion , down 16 % year-over-year . Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG & A cost , higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products . Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $ 721 million , growing 11 % year-over-year , driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business .

Our memory business had record revenue of $ 866 million , up 55 % year-over-year , with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply . We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations . This segment had an operating loss of $ 129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity . The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $ 425 million . Operating profit was $ 92 million , flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts . Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $ 534 million , and operating profit was $ 95 million . Consistent with our prior guidance , the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter . Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress : first , invest in our business ; second , strategic acquisitions ; and third , return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks . In the quarter , we generated $ 3.9 billion of cash from operations . We repurchased $ 2 billion in capital assets , paid $ 1.2 billion in dividends , increased the dividend by 5 % and repurchased about $ 1.2 billion of stock . In addition , we", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-INTC.txt"}}

We repurchased $ 2 billion in capital assets , paid $ 1.2 billion in dividends , increased the dividend by 5 % and repurchased about $ 1.2 billion of stock . In addition , we generated approximately $ 400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML , which generated $ 235 million of pretax gains . At quarter-end , cash and other long-term investments was $ 23.7 billion , up $ 600 million . Total debt was $ 25.8 billion . Today , we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $ 10 billion . Currently , we have approximately $ 15 billion authorization . We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time . Now let me turn to guidance . First , some context . First , while we see strong momentum in client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year , we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts . We feel great about our annual cadence and product innovations with new product launches planned this year , including Skylake for data center , 8th Generation Core , 64 Tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line . Second , we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels . Third , the data center business has solid momentum with the midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor . And fourth , as I indicated earlier , we completed the sale", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 11, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-INTC.txt"}}

Third , the data center business has solid momentum with the midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor . And fourth , as I indicated earlier , we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group . We expect to realize a pretax gain of approximately $ 375 million and a tax liability of approximately $ 850 million . This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39 % and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21 % in the second quarter . And last , as Brian talked about earlier , we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company , and we are making an important commitment to our owners today . We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017 , and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time . We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30 % of revenue , which we expect to reach no later than 2020 . As a result , we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $ 500 million to approximately $ 60 billion and our EPS guidance by $ 0.05 to approximately $ 2.85 per share . As we look to the second quarter of 2017 , we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $ 14.4 billion , up 11 % year-over-year excluding Intel Security and up 6 % including Intel Security . We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year-over-year ; gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63 % ; and spending to be approximately $ 5.2 billion , flat year-over-year", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 12, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-INTC.txt"}}

So the simple answer is , absolutely , we 're still committed to the high single-digit growth for the year . If you take a look at it , as Bob and I both mentioned in the call , when you take a look at Q1 comparatives , one , Q1 of last year was 14 weeks . This year , it 's a normal 13 weeks .

First , I thought it would be good to give you a little background , right , why we do we come out and commit this now and kind of what 's our thinking behind this . And part of it is we had good progress , brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1 % for 2016 . We 're a quarter in , and we 're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another -- slightly more than 1 % as we look at this year . And so we just really took a look at do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth . The growth we 've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February , which is that mid-single-digit type of growth for the overall company .

And that 's the -- against that , we 're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster , continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short , medium and long term .

On the depreciation , we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on a depreciation through course of the year . And what that assumes is roughly $ 2.5 billion additional CapEx from memory in the year . In terms of profitability , for this year , when we talked to you at Analyst Day , Rob kind of laid out a plan where the Core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year , but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016 . And that was a function of really 3 things : good performance on 3D NAND , continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint . So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year , and we said that near the end of 2018 , as a whole , the memory business would be profitable . And to the first quarter , growth was stronger than we expected , and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 13 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-INTC.txt"}}

And so taking 1 % a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth . And that is the effort that we 've spent over the last couple months really digging into those details . And that 's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said , yes , we are committing to that . We understand the details behind it . And we 've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Stacy Aaron Rasgon , Sanford C.

For my follow-up , I 'd like to ask about DCG margins . So they were 35 % this quarter . It does n't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter . This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else we 've discussed . But it 's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected . How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp ? And do you think , for the full year , you 'll actually be within the data center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert H.

Our expectations for this year were for growth , as Brian indicated earlier , high single digits and at the lower end of that range , of the 40 % to 45 % . In the first quarter , just to be clear , the 9-point drop in margin , 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business , and we 've indicated it will be first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer . As a result , it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG & A allocation . So 7 points of the 9 decline are simply a result of how we allocate costs to the business segments . I think in terms of going through the course of the year , the things that are going to change , as Brian indicated , we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year . We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year . As you know , the first quarter is always the lower end of margin seasonality -- from a seasonal perspective .

And Q1 was where we expected ; Q2 , consistent with Q1 and full year . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 45 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Kevin E.

Not all bits are going to be created equal . That 's a very differentiating technology . It 's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between . And so those bits are a bit different than , say , typical NAND bits , and I would n't want to just lump those all into a standard number . So we need to think about how we 'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint .

Q1 was Intel 's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January . Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well , producing growth within a declining PC market . And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses , booting McAfee up 25 % over the first quarter of last year . The strength of Intel 's business underscores my confidence in our strategy . What we 're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process , analyze , store and share that data . That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we 've made in memory , modems , FPGAs and autonomous vehicles . We 're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever . And importantly , we 're not just competing in these markets . We 're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate . Data Center Group revenue was up 24 % year-over-year . We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1 . And customer preference for high performance products , including Xeon Scalable drove a richer ASP mix . The cloud segment grew 45 % . And in the comm service provider segment , we continue to take share and grew revenue 33 % as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition .

Intel and KT deployed the world 's largest 5G network to date , including more than 20 5G links delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity . We 've established leadership in 5G . And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019 , we 'll be there with industry-leading products from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices . And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments . Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration . The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume , and those design wins are translating directly into revenue . PSG 's business grew 17 % in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last time buys . PSG 's data center segment was up 150 % over last year , and the Advanced products category , our 28- , 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew more than 40 % .

Our IoTG business grew 17 % on record unit volume with continuing momentum in the retail and video segment as compute increasingly moves to the edge . Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources , we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy . The memory business set a revenue record , growing 20 % in the first quarter , crossing over the $ 1 billion mark in revenue . The last business that passed that mark was DCG , crossing over that mark over a decade ago . Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule . In fact , we believe the Dalian Fab extension is one of the fastest brownfield of wafer starts projects in memory industry history . We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients , known as the 800 series , driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology . The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year . And we continue to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving , and I 'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months .

And we 're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace , including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer . And finally , the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment . The revenue was up 3 % despite a declining PC TAM on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments , leading to a strong core mix . The CCG launched its first ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter , again demonstrating our outright product leadership . We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process . We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving , so the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated . As a result , volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019 .

While it 's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies , we are able to optimize our process and products within a node to deliver meaningful performance improvements . For example , 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70 % since the first 14-nanometer products were launched . We combined these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture that produced truly a leadership product , and it 's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users . Intel and the industry stepped up for a tough challenge as we responded to the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown . I 'm pleased with our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners address this issue collaboratively , with transparency and with customer-first urgency . We 're delivering against our security-first pledge and we 've now rolled out micro code-based mitigation for all Intel products launched over the last 9 years that require protection against Spectre and Meltdown . We 'll also begin delivering both client and data center products with the hardware-based mitigations later this year .

Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018 . Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum . Revenue was a first quarter record of $ 16.1 billion , up 13 % year-over-year . Operating income was $ 4.8 billion , up 21 % year-over-year . And EPS of $ 0.87 was up 32 % year-over-year . From a capital allocation perspective , we generated $ 6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $ 3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend . As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business , we are raising our full year revenue guide by $ 2.5 billion to $ 67.5 billion . We 're raising our EPS guide by $ 0.30 to $ 3.85 . And we 're raising our free cash", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 8, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-INTC.txt"}}

Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company . Intel 's data-centric businesses were up 25 % collectively with each business individually growing double digits . Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50 % of our revenue , an all-time high . Our PC-centric business was up 3 % on strength in notebook , desktop and modem . DCG strong cash flows fund Intel 's investment in new data-centric growth . As a reminder , we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1 . The new standard drove $ 462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition . This predominantly affected CCG and NSG . By year-end , we expect roughly half of this to net out . Moving to Q1 earnings . We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter , up 32 % year-on-year . Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth , a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate . The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending , partially offset by a 1 point decline in gross margin .

As a second reminder , we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments . In 2017 , all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results . But in 2018 , all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings . In an effort to eliminate volatility , we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results . Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $ 0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results . We are also making excellent progress in our operating efficiencies . In January , we pulled in our 30 % spending goal from 2020 to 2019 , and we 're off to a good start in 2018 . Total spending was down 4 % year-over-year in the quarter . R & D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points . And our SG & A costs were down over 2 points . Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth , and it is paying off . Currently , as a result of strong top line growth , we now expect to meet our 30 % spending target in 2018 , 2 years ahead of our original expectations .

Q1 operating margin was 50 % . Overall , unit volume was up 16 % , and ASPs were up 7 % . We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASPs . Cloud and comms service providers segments were greater than 60 % of the data center business . And this was the first quarter our cloud business has surpassed $ 2 billion in revenue , which made it our largest segment in the first quarter . Additionally , we redefined our expanded TAM for DCG to markets beyond the CPU , like silicon photonics , Fabric , network ASICs and 3D XPoint memory . These adjacent businesses are gaining traction and grew 16 % year-over-year . DCG performance in all segments was better than our January forecast , and we expect that strength to continue to aid DCG momentum through the second quarter .

As you heard from Brian , the Mobileye business is going strong . Q1 revenue was $ 151 million . And while it 's early in the journey , we are on track to our deal thesis . Our memory business broke the $ 1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time , up 20 % year-over-year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions . We reduced our operating losses by $ 48 million with strong gigabyte demand and unit cost reductions more than offsetting ASP reductions .

That 's a good question . Let me try and answer it . So first thing I 'll tell you is that there is a bit here that is the transition to cloud continues to occur , occurring at a bit even faster rate so that -- you do see that trend is going on . But remember , we 've always talked about that over the long haul , you have to look at these , it can sometimes be lumpy .

Our view of long term there , I look out over the long term again , it 's still -- that should be in a declining mode versus moving those workloads long term over to the cloud . So if I take a look at this , as Bob said in his prepared remarks , so we look at -- if I look at our data-centric businesses in general , so even just beyond the data center , we see these growing in that mid- to high teens range . And that 's kind of how we view this . And we do believe that is sustainable . And it will move from cloud to enterprise . And sometimes , you 'll see IoT pick up a bit , offset something , but that 's why we grouped those into that data centric . But they 're all really tied together . It 's data coming from the edge , moving through the network into the data center and really being based in the cloud and analytics being applied to it and people using that data then to make decisions to drive businesses .

So I did want to make sure that , that was very clear to you and that was our densest , highest performing product out there . We 're slowing the ramp down as we go and fix the yields , and we were able to do that . A , we understand the yield issues . They 're really tied to this being the last technology tied to not having EUV and the amount of multi-patterning and the effects of that or defects . But also , the real strengths of 14-nanometers , I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we 've done 70 % improvements in the performance of that technology over its current life time .

We believe that if you take a look at others during this time frame , if you look at anybody else and said 70 % improvement on a technology note , yes , let me rename those nodes as we go through this . And we have always chosen to be really transparent and clean and just say , it 's improvements on the existing technology rather than renaming . So we believe we have that . Now as we look at -- out in time , we do see the density . You just take that component , the density gap is narrowing a bit . But that 's out in time .

But I think there 's a few dynamics that we 've been wrestling with . As you know , over the last couple of years we 've seen a gap between earnings and cash flow , and it 's really been driven by a couple of things . One , success and by that , I mean , accelerating rates of growth and the additional capital that goes along with that growth , both CapEx and inventory levels . So those have been one of the drivers . Secondly , we brought on 10-nanometer equipment but have n't necessarily put it to use yet . So that 's a cash driver without an impact on earnings . And third , memory is in the investment phase . So those 3 things have really been what 's been driving the gap , and we 've done a few things in light of that , that you 're aware of . One , memory , we engage in the strategic supply agreements that you mentioned , which really for us is a sign that our customers are excited and committed to the technologies that we 're building such that we can help -- we can use", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-INTC.txt"}}

One , memory , we engage in the strategic supply agreements that you mentioned , which really for us is a sign that our customers are excited and committed to the technologies that we 're building such that we can help -- we can use their money to help fund the scaling of the business . And we think that 's a good , positive short , medium and long-term move . And the other thing , just if you think about , Stacy , kind of how we guided this year , you have earnings -- if you do n't give us credit for the ICAP gains last year and strip that out , you see earnings growth that 's roughly 25 % , 26 % and you see free cash flow growth that 's in the mid-30s . So you 'll start to see that gap narrowing as we go through the course of this year . And then the other thing is we 're going to make a fairly significant cash tax payment in 2018 as a result of the ICAP gains from last year , and that 's roughly $ 1.2 billion that 's going to weigh on our cash flows this year . If you strip that out for a second , what you see during the course of 2018 is roughly 25 % earnings growth and roughly 50 % free cash flow growth , and that gap begins to narrow while we 're accelerating the growth rate of the business . So those are -- that 's kind of the dynamics in terms of how we 're deploying capital for accelerating top line growth and the improvements on free cash flow relative to earnings per share this year .", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-INTC.txt"}}

So the issues around 10 nanometers , I kind of tried to lay that out without getting too deep into the technology , but this is the last technology with -- that does n't incorporate EUV . And what you also need to understand is that we took very aggressive goals at 10 nanometers . So if you talk about the scaling factor or think about it as the multiple at which you shrink a feature , okay , we took a target of 2.7 . So you took any feature and 1 over 2.7 is the dimensional shrink that you get to this device . For example , on 14 nanometers , we took a", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 31, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-INTC.txt"}}

So you took any feature and 1 over 2.7 is the dimensional shrink that you get to this device . For example , on 14 nanometers , we took a target of 2.4 . So you 're almost 10 % more aggressive on 10 nanometers . And if you look at what more is the industry standard , what the foundries and other players are typically doing , they 're typically in that 1.5 to 2.0 range . So they 're -- we 're maybe 20 % more aggressive . So we took very aggressive goals to hit our cost targets and where we want the technology to be . And that , combined with end-of-life of emergent scanner before we hit EUV , has just created something that 's a little bit more difficult . And so that 's why I have the confidence that this is not something we 're shipping , that transistors work . We know the performance is in line . So it 's really just about getting the defects and the cost in line to where we want . As far as what does that imply for future technologies , we made a lot of changes at 7 nanometers . 7 nanometers currently is the first technology forecasted to implement EUV . So that immediately makes the lithography system different . We 're going back to a more standard for us compaction number of 2.4 So that makes it a little bit easy .

And thirdly , we are using some very unique packaging technologies and such that allow us that 7 nanometers and beyond , we really move into a world where you 're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node . You 're going to use what we 're going to call heterogeneous techniques that allow us to use silicon for multiple nodes . So you may use course from 7 nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 nanometers for the parts that do n't need the high performance . And we 're able to put those together and make them perform and behave like a single piece of silicon in the package . So really , 7 nanometers is quite a bit different , and so I think as a result , we do n't expect to see these kinds of impacts on 7 nanometers . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Christopher Brett Danely , Citigroup Inc , Research Division - MD [ 16 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 33, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-INTC.txt"}}

The issues seem to be going on now for some time , and it 's almost as if the design libraries or something are flawed .

So let me try and answer your question . So no , there 's nothing wrong with the design libraries or anything like that . I mean , the proof of that is that we 're shipping products . So if there were basic functionality issues like that , you would n't be able to produce and ship a product .

The second part of your question was would it benefit to just skip to 7 nanometers and would that have an effect on the capital or the gross margin . The simple answer is no , I do n't think that 's a good idea . The best answer is to fix -- there 's a lot of learning that will happen that we can carry forward in the 7 nanometers , just like we carried from 14 to 10 . The other thing is that we still hold roughly 80 % of our capital equipment is fungible to the next node or backwards to the prior node . And so that 's why as we shifted 10 and 14 , we 're able to do that without shifting our capital expenditures greatly . We 're able to just move the capacity back and forth . The same thing is going to happen between 10 and 7 . So you 'll have some percentage , and it 's always based on demand and how fast things are ramping and all of that . But the equipment will be fungible for the most part between 10 and 7 as well . But no , the right thing to do is exactly what we 're doing . This is a unique opportunity we have .

I 'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now . I 'll start with the client computing group , which had a stellar quarter . This team 's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products , improving product costs , and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37 % growth in CCG operating margins . The client computing group 's revenue grew 5 % over last year , but just as importantly , DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation . In the data center group , revenue grew 10 % year over year to a record $ 4.5 billion . We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast . The cloud service provider segment was up 32 % . In the [ com ] service provider segment , we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market , 16 % growth , as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase . In addition , non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34 % . This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric , which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum . It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi , all of which began their ramps this year .

However , enterprise revenue was down 3 % , trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year . As a result , DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits . Another key growth opportunity for Intel , our Internet of Things business , grew 19 % over last year , setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $ 700 million . We saw strength across the board in retail , video , and transportation segments . Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year . 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule , with yields matching those of our other production facilities . We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology , 3D Crosspoint , and we 're making steady progress toward bringing it into production . Intel 's programmable solutions group , formerly Altera , was up 6 % on strength in wireline , industrial , and broadcast segments . I 'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel . We continued to execute against our [ deal thesis ] , and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera 's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges . In the third quarter , we began sampling our Stratix 10 product , Intel 's first FPGA produced on our own process technology , and also , the industry 's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA .

PSG 's results show the tremendous progress and execution . The Intel security business was up 6 % over last year . Last month we announced that we will sell 51 % of Intel security to private equity firm TPG , and establish a jointly-owned , independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee . This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee 's success and growth .

Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $ 689 million , growing 19 % year over year , driven by strength in our retail , video , and transportation segments . Operating profit for the business was $ 191 million , up 27 % year over year . Our memory business had revenue of $ 649 million , down 1 % year over year .

Our security business had revenue of $ 537 million , up 6 % from a year ago . In the third quarter , we announced a newly formed , jointly owned , independent cybersecurity Company called McAfee . The transaction values the business at approximately $ 4.2 billion , and at deal close , we expect to realize a pretax gain on this sale of roughly $ 500 million when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017 . The costs associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and spending guide . Post deal close , we will own 49 % of the new Company . We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow , which enables us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders . This is demonstrated in our third-quarter results , as we generated $ 5.8 billion of cash from operations , purchased $ 2.5 billion in capital assets , repaid $ 1 billion in commercial paper , repurchased approximately $ 500 million of stock , and paid $ 1.2 billion in dividends .

This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter , as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce the inventory . Since the last earnings call , our view of second-half 2016 revenue has increased , as a result of strength in the client computing and Internet of Things groups , partially offset by weakness in the enterprise segment of the data center . We are now forecasting the midpoint of the fourth-quarter gross margin to be 63 % . Spending is expected to be approximately $ 5.2 billion . Intel is in the midst of a significant transformation . We are focusing on being more efficient , investing in higher growth segments , and with the McAfee transaction , we are focusing our business on core strategic areas . Given that , I would like to provide a little more context on each . We are on track to achieve the run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year , and in fact , we are moving faster than we anticipated . In addition , the deal involving the Intel security group , which was announced in the third quarter , will result in additional restructuring charges , a pretax gain , and reduced spending levels in 2017 .

We are on track to the original restructuring and focusing our business on core strategic areas . This is allowing incremental investments in critical areas like the data center , Internet of Things , and memory . The overall impact of the announced reductions , Intel security group transaction , and reinvestment is that we expect our 2016 spending as a percent of revenue to be down almost 1 point versus 2015 , and we expect to achieve another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation .

The one that was probably a little bit of a shift is China , it was a little bit better than we had forecasted as well . Enterprise was again strong . Consumer was better , but it 's still not back to where we consider it -- where we 'd like to see the consumer side . And it was a good mix between desktop and mobile products , laptops , and two-in-ones and devices like that . So it was an increase in what 's been strong in the past is really what drove the growth for this quarter . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mark Henninger , Intel Corporation - Head of IR [ 6 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Oct-18", "chunk_index": 16, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Oct-18-INTC.txt"}}

But then the thing that really kicked in this quarter is they 're ramping their first 14-nanometer server product , which is Broadwell for the server market , and that -- those first products coming out on that product line are fairly expensive . To the mix question , it does n't really drive things probably as much as you would expect . We have very strong product margins across the portfolio of server products in the enterprise or in the data center , ranging from enterprise to storage to networking . And in fact , when we look at the server ASPs , we actually saw ASPs up across the board in every one of our server categories , so NP , DP .

Maybe let me help you just think about the data center from a larger perspective , right . As Stacy said , what you have to really take a look here is the growth areas that we said we were going to continue to grow in , the cloud service provider , the telco space , the networking and storage , networking specifically is some of our fastest growing areas of the data center . And in the adjacencies , which are all new , emerging markets for us around things like Silicon Photonics and Omni-Path fabric and all , all of those are growing at or above what we had forecasted . And doing quite well . And as Stacy said , across each of those , our ASPs are both increasing . And if you take a look at that , even if you go down to like an Atom server , the Atom-based server , yes , their ASPs are lower , but the margins are still quite healthy down there because their costs are quite a bit lower . So you 've got to keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across these . What happened this quarter is that we had anticipated the Enterprise to go from that low single-digit decline to roughly flat , and it just has n't -- the enterprise market has n't shored up there yet .

And we 're very comfortable . It does n't really matter for us , from a product definition or product performance standpoint , whether it goes -- those applications go to the cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise . That said , there 's several enterprises that we are in talks with that all want to grow their own private clouds , and they 're really looking at how best to do that , when do they do that .

Your question on accelerators really is what you 're asking when you take a look at GPUs and things like deep learning . The first thing you have to separate out is things like is -- are you talking about the deep learning on the learning portion or the scoring portion ? So we do n't look at accelerators as cannibalistic , because you still have to have a Xeon system with those when you go to actually do the implementation of the deep learning application .

The second thing we tell you is that we actually had worked over the last two years or so to really implement a much broader collection of accelerators , when you think about these . If you want to think about the rates of performance of each one of these , you have FPGAs which are accelerators , and we see those accelerators go into everything from networking devices to machine learning applications . Those have high levels of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly , but maybe not quite the performance . Then you have GPUs . GPUs do have , as you say , good accelerating performance in certain linear algorithms . Those are quite good , and we have our Xeon Phi in that space . And then the highest performance area are ASICs , where they 're very workload-specific and designed around the algorithm specifically , and you saw our applications of Nervana . We also did an acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter . Those are all very specific workloads around machine learning that are ASIC-driven and even give higher performance . So we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth . You sell a Xeon typically with that so it does n't cannibalize the business . We believe we have the lightest really offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into ASIC-driven devices . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Vivek", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Oct-18", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Oct-18-INTC.txt"}}

Just on the PC , you guys were pretty much first to call the inventory burn in Q1 of this year . In terms of your call for inventory burn in the PC channel for Q4 , is this reflected in your order book ? Is this what your customers and channel partners are telling you ? Or is this you guys think that , hey , things were a little too good in Q3 so they have to ease up a little bit in Q4 ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian Krzanich , Intel Corporation - CEO [ 47 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I 'd tell you it 's some mix .

We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview to the start of just showing you by segment there , cloud , telco , networking and storage , and then the adjacencies . They all grew at or above our forecast . Those are still , as we talked about earlier in one of the questions , growing in a percentage of our overall data center business . So they were n't quite enough to offset the 3 percentage decline in the enterprise side . But absolutely , that was the story for the quarter . We 're quite happy , and I think our thesis of what continues to drive their growth is holding . When we go out and talk to our partners and customers about what 's driving cloud growth , what 's going to drive the networking and storage requirements out in time , we start to look at devices like autonomous cars and the IoT network in general , all of those things are driving large requirements into those data centers in those growth segments .

I was just out there and Brian was being a little humble . The yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature production facility , which is a phenomenal result for a factory . So they 're doing quite well . In terms of the overall margin , if you look at the -- let 's just focus on Q3 . What we saw in Q3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by increased start-up costs associated with Dalian , China , and some increased costs associated with 3-D Crosspoint . As Brian said , when we get into the first half of next year , those products are ramping . And so we should start to see pretty significant improvements in the overall P & L because that headwind , if you will , goes away and we have a very competitive , very cost competitive product line that we 're selling in the marketplace . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian Krzanich ,", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Oct-18", "chunk_index": 55, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Oct-18-INTC.txt"}}

So we do n't think we see -- if we were going to see performance-based cannibalization , you 'd see it in those real high-level performance sectors first actually , I would think . So we do n't see that . On the Purley platform , we 're actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers . And they 're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these , but this also continues our integration of things like the Omni-Path fabric . It has more integration of the Silicon Photonics . So it 's those adjacency functions that are quite strong as you -- and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these . There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3-D Crosspoint . It allows pooling of memory , and then there will be future ones that allow additional pooling of things like FPGAs .

Okay . And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losses . I know that you do n't break out MCG anymore . But I think I asked you last call about feeling good about this $ 800 million improvement in losses this year . That would get you to roughly a loss of 2.2 to 2.3 in the former MCG .

So I 'm not going to confirm or anything on a particular win . But I 'll take you back to the mobile loss here . So as you got right , we no longer have a mobile segment ; we have n't for a while . We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $ 800 million . We actually ended up closer to $ 1 billion . We said , hey , based on everything we know of what 's going on with contra revenue and investments and margin improvements and all of that , that we 'd expect something on the order of an $ 800 million improvement in 2016 . Everything I know from there would say we 're on track or exceeding that , just because we know that as we 've gone through our restructuring , we 've made some further disinvestments . We 've , as you just heard earlier , our volume 's a little lower , our contra revenue 's looking a little lower , the product margins all look good . So I 'm not seeing anything that would say it 's smaller . If anything , it 's going to be bigger in terms of the overall savings .

Can you just talk about the sustainability of the double-digits year-over-year growth trends and the sustainability of the 20 % -plus operating margins on a go-forward basis ? I know you mentioned broad-based strength across the verticals .

So I 'm trying to make sure I really think about what question you 're asking . From a -- can we sustain the double-digit growth ? We absolutely believe that we can , and we 've tested that with our -- the deals that we see on the plate going forward . So we 've forward tested that . And we 've looked at our product road maps and what we 're bringing out . And we 've got products like Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak 2 that are coming that are Broxton-based products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment , and priced and designed right for that . The segments are going to continue to believe -- be , we believe , the video analytics segment ; that continues to go well . There are other segments of the industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine automation , machine factory automation , think of it as factory automation . The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow . And then automotive , and you saw us make deals , for example , this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving , which is a little further out . But that 's just an example .

And then automotive , and you saw us make deals , for example , this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving , which is a little further out . But that 's just an example .

And those systems are quite -- we 're thinking of them more and more as servers on wheels , as you start looking at all of the adjacencies too . They 're needing connectivity . They 're needing storage . They 're needing Silicon Photonics for moving the infotainment , basically the graphics video around the system . They use FPGAs for accelerators , like we talked about earlier . So when we look across those segments and we test it out , we do believe we can continue that . Those are also high compute areas , and it 's what gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well . They tend to reuse a lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down over into it . That 's one of the real strengths of Intel 's integrated device manufacturing business model . And so the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less than if you start from scratch and that 's your only product .

On the cellular modem front , obviously the team is driving good success here with the 7360 this year . Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps . I notice that your next-generation platform , the 7480 , was just qualified at AT & T just this month . This was actually about the same time last year that you guys qualified the 7360 at AT & T . Now that it 's qualified , can you just help us understand when should we expect 7480 to show up in mobile devices ? Would this be 2017 , and any other color you can provide us in terms of other global carriers that you 've qualified this new chip set with ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian Krzanich , Intel Corporation - CEO [ 82 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Oct-18", "chunk_index": 74, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Oct-18-INTC.txt"}}

So I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence . I think that 's what it 's taking us a while to get to is to get to that annual pace . But we really believe we 're on a clip now . As you said , the 7480 is now qualified . As you said , it 's qualified at AT & T there . We typically go then out and around the world . So you 'll see it at many of the same places that the 7360 got qualified , in Europe , in China , other parts of southeast Asia . So those will be ongoing now . And you should just think about we 're really targeting modem technology advancements on that annual basis , and typically , you 're right ; they get qualified in the third and fourth quarter of the year before . And then customers start to roll out those devices , typically , more towards the second half of the following year . So you should see these things start to show up in devices in the second half of 2017 . And you should just think about that from this business from here on .

We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances . We generated $ 19.8 billion in revenue , expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $ 1.45 in earnings per share . We exceeded our guidance by $ 800 million on the top line and $ 0.15 on the bottom line . Our data-centric businesses grew 34 % and now represent approximately 51 % of the company 's revenue , and our PC-centric business grew 14 % . We 'll talk about business trends later , but first , I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge . I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift . I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment . I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites . Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our # 1 priority .

We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories ' operations . By design , our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world . While most of our construction projects have remained operational , we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites . We will restart those projects in due course , and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line . We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world 's innovation in new ways . Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis . To that end , we 've pledged $ 50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care , to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers .

This will aid community organizations focused on food security , shelter , medical equipment and small business support . We also want to assist our communities ' critically important health care workers in any way possible , so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment . We have already started delivering masks , gloves , face shields and other gear that we 've sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need . Beyond Intel 's donations , our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills , generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis . George will give more detail on what we 're seeing and expect in the business . But first , I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities .

Over the last several years , we 've transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history . We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer , including our homes , our cars , our cities , our hospitals and our factories . Additionally , we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we 've expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS , FPGAS , GPUs and Optane , among other capabilities . Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers ' success . And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity . Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move , store and process data . Through this crisis , the world 's cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers . Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago , such as online shopping and video collaboration , have now become indispensable . We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53 % and 33 % year-over-year , respectively , to help our customers meet these growing needs . These 2 segments now drive 70 % of our data center segment revenue .

New usage and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery , giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge . Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms , including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19 . One example is Medical Informatics ' Sickbay platform . Powered by Intel technology , this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes , helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly . Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within 1 day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers . We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators . We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving . While auto vehicle production is largely stalled , Mobileye delivered another proof point , demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM . Finally , we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make . AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries , including cutting-edge health care diagnostics , for example , in China , Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19 .

And in India , we are working with government labs , academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing , accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform . We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent , fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $ 25 billion by 2024 . This quarter , we have largely completed the integration . We consolidated product road maps , aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis . We are also now sampling Habana 's first deep learning training processor to large CSPs . I 'll now take a few minutes to discuss how we 're executing to our supply and road map objectives . Shortly after our January call , we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China , forcing many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns . ODM partners have now returned to work , and production is increasing every week . As I mentioned earlier , our factories remain operational .

Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside . Q1 PC-centric revenue was $ 9.8 billion , up 14 % year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year . Gross margin for the quarter was 62 % , beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue , partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business . Operating margin of 38 % in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls , consistent with the environment . Q1 EPS was $ 1.45 , $ 0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance , partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios , along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate . The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment .

With Q1 buybacks at $ 4.2 billion , we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year . In addition , our dividend policy remains unchanged with $ 1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1 . Let 's move to segment performance in Q1 . Data Center Group revenue of $ 7 billion was up 43 % from the prior year , coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape . Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27 % and 13 % , respectively . While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 '19 , revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG . Revenue was up 53 % in cloud , 34 % in enterprise and government and 33 % for communication service providers . DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35 % year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions .

While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue , we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19 . NSG revenue grew 46 % on strong bit growth and improved pricing . Better market conditions versus last year , along with cost reductions on strong factory performance , resulted in a lower operating loss of $ 66 million . PSG revenue grew 7 % year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength , partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment . Operating income was up 9 % on higher revenue . CCG revenue was $ 9.8 billion in Q1 , up 14 % year-over-year , driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales . PC unit volumes were up 13 % year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply . Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders .

Given the environment and the global economy , the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal . Based on demand signals from our customers , we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2 , while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19 . As a result , we expect total revenue of $ 18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25 % year-over-year . Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30 % , down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin , largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue . Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56 % , down 6 points sequentially due primarily to 3 reasons : prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product , code named Tiger Lake ; lower sequential revenue ; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products , including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC . The Tiger lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year .

In particular , mobile PCs , cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends . Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets , particularly industrial and retail , lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand . We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID . Also , given the volatility of the margins in Q1 , our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $ 0.03 .

And what you 're seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue . And about half of the impact that you 're seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves . Obviously , the fact that -- and that 's both sequentially and year-over-year . And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we 're not seeing anything as -- if you take COVID out of the year , we 're really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2020-Apr-23", "chunk_index": 20, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Apr-23-INTC.txt"}}

I mean I think one of the things -- we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake . And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter , it 's about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of '19 . And yet we have about double the number of units in the -- being reserved .

On the second part of your question , I 'd go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring , which is , obviously , when we transition from a mature node to a new node , margins tend to come down . We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2- to 2.5-year cadence , which means in 2021 , we 'll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we 're investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021 .

I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home , learn-at-home dynamics . But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast , which really reflected the dynamics that we 're talking about . We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some -- a little bit of inventory , which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically . But we saw notebook volumes up over 20 % in the quarter . And I would say that that 's more than just the pent-up demand . And that 's at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains , which is why there 's some parts in their channel that 's all opened up now . So we think that actually -- one of the good signs is though even that 's opened up , we 're still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side . So -- and we had expected solid PC in the first half . But I would say it 's -- with COVID , it 's been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the netbook . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert H.

We 're already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG , particularly in industrial and retail . We 're seeing in automotive , Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1 . But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year . Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow . They 're in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially . And they have the leadership position in ADAS . And so it will be more subtle of an impact , but still an impact nonetheless . And then as Bob said , on the data center side , enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half , and so we would expect some digestion .

The temporary impact is really the reserve action , which will reverse . It is about half of the year-over-year effect .

First , the review of our results . Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we increased revenue 7 % and net income 9 % . The Client Computing Group , Data Center Group , Internet of Things , and Intel Security all grew in 2016 , with DCG and IoTG setting full-year revenue and volume records . The acquisition of Altera added 3 percentage points to our overall growth rate . In the Data Center , cloud service provider revenue grew 24 % , while enterprise revenue was down 3 % for the full year . Additionally , we are very excited that Com Service Provider revenue grew 19 % . And across all of our customer categories , adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21 % , with strength in ethernet controllers , Omni-Path fabric controllers and switches , and network ASICs . IoT revenue was up 15 % for the full year , driven by strength in the video , retail , and industrial segment . In Q4 , we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake product , and we won key designs in automotive and video . Our Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue , while full-year revenue was down 1 % . This was an investment year for the memory business , but NSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter .

We 're now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab68 , and we just qualified our first 3D cross point-based Optane SSD , which we expect to ship for revenue in the first quarter . And our 3D cross point memory DIMMs are sampled to Data Center customers . The Client Computing business achieved impressive results , driven by strong execution and higher ASPs , as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core product . This was also a breakout year for CCG 's wireless communications product line . Our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume and we shipped record Wi-Fi units . I 'm very proud of the Client Computing business , and what this team has delivered in 2016 . Our strategy of delivering consistent product leadership , segmentation , and differentiation paid off . We achieved record i7 units , and overall core mix in 2016 . And Client Computing revenue was up 2 % for the year , despite the declining PC market . The Programmable Solutions Group was up about 7 % on a non-GAAP basis over Altera 's 2015 results . PSG saw strength across many segments , with particular strength in compute and storage . The Programmable Solutions business sampled the industry 's first , and only , 14-nanometer FPGAs this year , known as Stratix 10 . This product line has the largest demand pipeline in Altera 's history . The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a transformative year for Intel .

This team did a great job of meeting integration objectives , while continuing to deliver new products and grow the business . In 2016 , we took other important , and in some cases difficult , steps to position the Company for future success , improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy , and accelerate our transformation to the company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices . Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and technologies that will fuel our growth . And that work , combined with improvements in 14-nanometer costs , drove a 30 % operating margin improvement in our Client business . Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate , independent company was another transformative move . This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility to invest independently , tighten our focus , and allow Intel to share in McAfee 's future success as the market demand for world-class security product continues to grow . And finally , looking ahead to 2017 at Intel 's future , I am confident we are making the right investments to compete and win , not only in the segments where Intel is strong today , but also in new areas that are poised for growth driven by the emerging flood of data . By 2020 , the average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes of data per day , while smart and connected devices of the future will produce data at many times that rate . Autonomous cars , for example , will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day .

Autonomous cars , for example , will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day . The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunity . But data alone is n't valuable . It is the transmission , aggregation , and analysis of the data that results in value and impact . Intel will play a central role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw data into high-value insight and information . Our investments in advanced research and development are making this all possible , while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time . These investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous driving , where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the vehicle and the data center ; to 5G where we are building on our momentum in 4G to establish leadership ; to artificial intelligence , where we are providing the industry 's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions , from the edge to the data center . We are already seeing signs of progress . In autonomous driving , we are winning key designs like BMW , Delphi , and Baidu . In 5G , we are leading in the definition of standards , prototyping , and field trial . Our Network business saw strong growth as infrastructure moved to Intel architecture in anticipation of 5G .

Revenue was up 10 % , operating income was up 11 % , and EPS was up 4 % year over year . Revenue set an all-time record at $ 16.4 billion , and operating income was $ 4.9 billion . Fourth-quarter operating margin was 30 % , flat year over year . Gross margin , at 63 % , was down 2 points , primarily driven by a couple of one-time events related to product warranty cost , and long-term IP agreements . Direct spending came in at $ 5.4 billion , up 4 % year over year , and down 2 points as a percent of revenue . Earnings per share of $ 0.79 was up $ 0.03 from a year ago . The Client Computing Group had revenue of $ 9.1 billion , up 4 % year over year . During the fourth quarter , the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy , and we saw some inventory burn during the quarter . Client ASPs were up 7 % year over year , and core mix was at an all-time high as a result of the success of our segmentation strategies , and strength in gaming and high-end systems . This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth , with operating profit growing 30 % from a year ago , as the business continues to benefit from lower spending , richer product mix , and continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit costs .

The Data Center Group had operating profit of $ 1.9 billion , down 14 % year over year . Operating margin was impacted by the two one-time items I referred to earlier , and the ramp of 14 nanometer on our server products , which we expect to generate continued cost improvements over time . Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $ 726 million , growing 16 % year over year , driven by strength in both retail and industrial segment . Operating profit for the business was $ 182 million , up 37 % year over year . Our Memory business had a record revenue of $ 816 million , up 25 % year over year , with strong demand for Data Center SSD solutions , with demand signals outpacing supply . We have made great progress ramping Fab68 , with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectation .

Turning to the full-year 2016 , revenue grew 7 % , operating margin grew 11 % , and EPS grew 9 % . Operating margin percent improved by 1 point , while gross margin was approximately 63 % , flat to 2015 . Spending was $ 21 billion , or 35.4 % of revenue , down 1 point from 2015 , primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year . Operating profit for the year was $ 16.5 billion . Earnings per share for the year was $ 2.72 , up $ 0.23 from the prior year . In 2016 , the business generated record cash from operations of $ 21.8 billion . We purchased $ 9.6 billion in capital assets , paid $ 4.9 billion in dividends , and repurchased about $ 2.6 billion of stock . Total cash balance was $ 17.1 billion , down $ 8.2 billion .

First , our guidance assumes a stable macroeconomic environment , but we have taken a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties , particularly in our outlook for the emerging markets including Russia , China , and Latin America . Second , for the Data Center , we continue to expect similar growth rates in the cloud and com segment , but we are not expecting an improvement in enterprise . This gets us to an expectation of high-single-digit growth in the Data Center business . Third , as a reminder , we have one less week as a result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016 . And last , we have assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2 , and our full-year guidance reflects one full quarter of the Group 's consolidated results . We have lots of work to do to close this out , and in the event the close happens at the end of the second quarter , we would update our full-year guidance by approximately an additional $ 500 million of revenue , and $ 100 million of operating income . As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017 , we are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $ 14.8 billion , up 7 % year over year , and down from the fourth quarter .

We expect EPS to be approximately $ 0.65 , up 20 % year over year . Turning to the full-year 2017 , we are expecting revenue to be roughly flat . Revenue is expected to grow in the low-single digits , after excluding the Intel Security Group from both years . We expect operating margin percent to be up 1 point year over year , with flat gross margins , and direct spending as a percent of revenue , down 1 point versus 2016 . Let me provide a bit more detail on our year-over-year direct spending . Our restructuring plans are on track , including reducing our headcount by approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $ 1.6 billion . We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments , and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in Moore 's Law , and expand TAM opportunities , such as memory and autonomous driving . We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue , in 2017 .

Our CCG business is focused and executing extremely well in a declining market , and provides the scale that is required to advance Moore 's Law , generates significant cash flows , and enables investments for growth . Our growth-oriented businesses were up 15 % collectively , as we continue to transform the Company from PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud .

Real good performance , and those are the dynamics we are expecting in 2017 . On the DCG front , good in Q4 and then project forward . Nice ASP performance in the quarter , as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell , and as we think about Skylake in 2017 , we expect that to continue . Unit costs in DCG is a little bit higher , because we are coming off great unit cost performance on 22nm , but as we migrate to 14nm . In the earlier stages of that cycle , unit costs are a little bit higher . And then we are increasing our investments in DCG on a year-over-year basis . So , dynamics are relatively good . The one , I referred to it a little earlier , but in terms of Q4 , we had a couple one-time items that really weighed on the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well-bounded , and do not expect to continue into 2017 . And just quickly , one we entered in a long-term cross-license agreement and patent-purchase agreement particularly in the com space in the quarter . And DCG was impacted by a portion of that cost in the quarter . But secondly , and a little more significant , we were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter .

Those two things put us in the PC market at a unit level in the mid-single-digit decline . That is better if you went back a year ago we were in the high single-digit . Depending on how you looked at it , and where you counted some the 2-in-1 devices . So it is starting to get better , but I do n't think we are back at a zero unit or positive unit . But as Bob said , what we have been really focusing on in that space is how do you make money ? How do you sell up ? How do you do better business performance in that kind of market ?

As we said , we took a look at the 2017 view on Enterprise to be relatively equivalent to what we saw in 2016 . Which says that Enterprise continues to decline .

Remember , for us , Enterprise is now less than 50 % of our overall Data Center business . And areas that are growing even faster , or as fast as cloud in most cases , are the networking and storage space , which we have very low market share in still , and it is a great opportunity for us . And in the emerging areas like Silicon Photonics , Omni-Path fabric , Rack Scale Design and 3D Xpoint .

It gets a little complex with Q1 -- end of Q1 target there . But let 's just talk about it in general . What we 've always said , is that we were going to go through the program that we went through at the middle of last year , which we called [ ACT ] just continued through the end of last year , 2016 and we said would be completed about the middle of 2017 .

We said the key areas around Data Center in general , we have Rack Scale Design , we have 3D Xpoint , we have artificial intelligence , around IoT , and we are making a big bets around autonomous driving . And so , you see us making the investment in HERE -- the investments with BMW . And that 's really , when you take a look at autonomous driving , and why are we doing that ? It is around Data and Data Centers , again . Remember , every one of those high-definition maps is going to require data centers , they are going to require small data centers at the edge . So , it 's all around , are we understanding and managing how data is going to flow in that system ? And then memory itself .

I think , the one thing worth noting is -- in our ICAP Portfolio in 2016 , we had a fairly significant gain , and what I indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect , roughly in 2017 , that gain to be inline with what 2016 generated .

For my follow-up , I wanted to , again , dig into the OpEx . You talked about a mix of the restructure and the cuts versus the reinvestment . But if I throw the McAfee cost back in , you 've actually got OpEx going up fairly sizably year-over-year , and your employee count is actually up year-over-year , even though you supposedly had a pretty big layoff . So I guess , can you talk little bit more specifically about exactly what the additional spending is going on ? Is it people , versus technology , versus something else ? Where is it going ?

Again , on a more macro basis , at the risk of maybe repeating myself , we are investing more in DCG , and in particular , bringing some of these adjacent products that Brian referred to , to market . We continue to invest in memory , and particularly in the 3D Xpoint product , and we continue to invest in IoT . So those three businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the investment , because those are the businesses that we have seen really strong growth in 2016 , and we are counting on continued growth in 2017 .

And then again , third , 7nm , a technology investment , and the spend associated with building a new pilot line in 2017 , is also an additional investment . So we are executing on our restructuring programs .

So , even look at the places where we 're going in the Data Center , and this is my point earlier about Enterprise versus cloud . Enterprise is now less than 50 % of our total makeup for the Data Center group . And the cloud is growing great , and that will continue , but if you look at the areas -- the majority of the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade , in the Data Center alone , it 's networking and storage where we have very low market share today . But we are bringing things like software defined networking , and NFV to those . And so that is growing and expanding TAM , as those markets move to Intel architecture . And then it is , going into Rack Scale Design , Omni-Path fabric , Silicon Photonic , those are all , again , new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us . Autonomous cars and the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us . 5G is a TAM that is brand-new that will be really being built out over the rest of this decade .

Brian , my first question , I want to go back to the DCG ASPs in the December quarter . There were up 4 % year-over-year , which reverses , I think , a four or five quarter trend of ASPs going down . I know that you 've had mix headwinds that have been driving blended ASPs down . I am curious , what happened the fourth-quarter to drive ASPs up , and do you think it is sustainable ? Is this just what we would expect to see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch ? And then it normalizes going forward ?

And secondly , in the coms and network space , which is a share-gain opportunity for us in DSG , getting those clients to move up the stack in terms of the high-performance server CPUs is the second dynamic .

And then maybe as my follow-up , Brian , relative to the guide , you 're kind of expecting a significant drop in free cash flow this year , with the increase in CapEx . And you highlighted that CapEx is going to the non-volatile memory group . I 'm just curious , given that business , even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar fourth quarter , is still in a loss position . I 'm assuming the higher CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability . But I guess , how do you think about the path to profitability ? The longer-term business model in memory ? And what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer term if Xpoint is successful ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian Krzanich , Intel Corporation - CEO [ 40 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Sure .

But , we are in this space for one reason . Because , I understand it is a cyclical business , that tends to be fairly difficult from a price-capacity standpoint . But , we believe we are coming at it with two , very unique technologies . Our 3D NAND technology has some of the best performance and best cost in the market . Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15 % price -- or cost value over the competition , and our next version , second-generation has even a higher , when you look at it on a density basis . And so , we believe we are going to be able to bring differential cost and performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position . And that combined with our knowledge of the Data Center should allow us to really provide compelling products for Data Center SSDs . 3D Xpoint is very different in that it 's a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage . And , we believe it can rearchitect how big data applications , artificial intelligence applications where you want large amounts of data being brought up as close to the compute as you can , will really transform , not only the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems .

At the same time , we believe as the world becomes connected , cloud will grow at a much faster rate . And , I made a point in the prepared remarks , where if you look at the cloud of today , seeing mostly based on people -- the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data a day .

We are entering 2017 with a continued tightness in supply . That makes pricing stable to better . So , we expect that , at least , right now the estimates are through the first half . It 's pretty hard to project out to the second half , and so we have kind of kept the second half relatively calm and cautious . If you take a look at 3D Xpoint , as we said we 've qualified . We 've started to ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys . Those are targeted for 2018 revenue shipment . On an SSD basis , we will start shipping for revenue this quarter .

If I look at 2016 , as we showed , we had about 7 % growth over what Altera had in 2015 . If you take a look at it , there is a couple of big segments that are driving that , Telco , Data Center , and we are starting to see -- and in the networking space as well . Those a kind of the big three segments . And we started to see as we went through , especially the back of the year , a good connection between our ability to go in , and we are better together , with Xeon and the FPGA , as we go into that networking space . Again , as our footprint grows in networking and storage , I think it also gives us an ability to continue to bring both products to those markets .

And we believe we will gain a little bit of share , again , in 2017 . And , remember these markets are slow-moving . You do n't grow 10 % share instantly , because of design cycles and design conversions are relatively difficult . It is again driven by Data Center , Networking , and the telco industry . And with Stratix 10 , as we said , largest design enablement in the history of Altera , so we are really excited . We believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers , that is truly industry-leading and shifting . And , so we are very comfortable -- or confident in that , but again that will really start to shift in the second half of 2017 . And so , I think that will really be driving growth in 2018 . And really if you think about these design cycles , that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next three years , plus , just because these cycles are fairly long . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Bill Peterson , JPMorgan - Analyst [ 64 ]", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 64, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-INTC.txt"}}

Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations , and marked a strong finish to the year . Taken as a whole , 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy , which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world . That strategy is also resulting in the evolution of our business model , to focus on three key areas of growth : The data center , the Internet of Things , and memory . Our results reflect that evolution .

Our results reflect that evolution . Revenue for the year was nearly flat , despite a significant decline in PC demand . 2015 was also a year of revenue records and important milestones , and I 'd like to take a minute to review some of them with you . Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8 % , we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters . As of November , 14-nanometer products made up more than 50 % of the client computing volume . And for the year , high end Core i7 micro processors and our K SKUs for gaming both set all-time volume records , leading to a rich product mix . In our security business , we 've refocused the organization on end point technology , where we enjoy a solid leadership position , and we 've driven material efficiencies , as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel . The results of these changes have been dramatic . On a constant currency basis , security revenue rose 6 % for the year , while the organization 's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44 % improvement in operating income . The IoT group grew revenue 7 % in 2015 to $ 2.3 billion , an all-time record . As the retail , transportation and video segments all saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth .

As the retail , transportation and video segments all saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth . In our NAND solutions group , we introduced a revolutionary new class of memory called 3D XPoint , the industry 's first new memory technology in more than two decades . 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at work , using our technology expertise to innovate and expand into profitably adjacent markets . We think it 's a game-changing technology , moving forward . Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter that we were upgrading our Dalian , China fab to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint , with production beginning later this year . For the full year , our memory business grew more than 20 % to $ 2.6 billion , another all-time record . At the same time , the Data Center Group grew 11 % over last year to an all-time record of $ 16 billion in revenue . Macro weakness weighed on enterprise demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of the year . However , DCG 's overall performance highlighted the underlying trends driving data center demand , as cloud and communication service providers ' revenue both grew more than 20 % for the year . Within the cloud segment , 40 % of our volume was custom SKUs as we left the year , demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the customers to tailor solutions to their needs .

Finally , just after our fiscal year ended , we closed our acquisition of Altera . We 're thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel . Combined , our two companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel 's process technology leadership , and the integration of Altera 's FPGAs . Wrapping up , our results over the last year leave me increasingly confident in our strategy . While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution about overall demand , particularly in China , we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016 . Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders , we will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business . This business provides a foundation of IP , and a source of cash flow , but it 's not the sole driver of our growth . Our future as a Company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle of opportunities in the data center , memory and IoT market segments . In fact , you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 results . DCG , IoTG and memory delivered nearly 40 % of Intel 's revenue , and more than 60 % of Intel 's operating margin in 2015 .

The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year , with record revenue at $ 14.9 billion . We had record revenues in the data center and Internet of Things businesses . Gross margin of 64 % was up 2 points to outlook , net income was $ 3.6 billion , down 1 % year-over-year , and earnings per share was $ 0.74 , flat over the same horizon .

We issued about $ 9.5 billion of new long-term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera , and in November we announced an $ 0.08 dividend increase to $ 1.04 per share on an annual basis , effective in the first quarter of 2016 . The acquisition of Altera was completed in early FY16 , which means that the 2016 guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business . As I talk to our guidance for 2016 , it is important to note that we have excluded non-cash and one-time acquisition-related charges for Altera . The CFO commentary pre-released before this call and available on INTC.com includes the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations . For the first quarter of 2016 , the midpoint of the revenue range is expected to be $ 14.1 billion . This forecast , which includes an extra work week , and the newly-acquired FPGA business , is on the low end of the average seasonal range . This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth , particularly in China . We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy , with appropriate levels of inventory .

Turning to the full year 2016 , we are expecting revenue growth in the mid to high single digits , relative to 2015 . This outlook is higher than our previous guidance provided at the November investor meeting . This higher range is driven by the addition of the FPGA business , partially offset by some caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment . Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63 % , and spending is expected at $ 21.3 billion . The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $ 9.5 billion , up from 2015 . As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens , we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years . This change in depreciable life drives approximately $ 1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for the year . Inclusive of this change , we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $ 6.5 billion this year , down $ 1.3 billion from 2015 . Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the Company . We are pivoting towards the cloud , with a diversified portfolio of businesses .

But very importantly , we 're investing in areas that we think are critical for the long-term growth and health of the Company , and where we get lots of return , i.e. , the data center , the Internet of Things , our process technology leadership , the memory business . So , we knew going into this year it would be a time of elevated investment .

Really excited ; we 're starting to dig in to some of the product road maps . The good news is , we 'd been working separate companies on the first of the server chips , which is a multi-chip package , so , FPGA and our Xeon in the same package . That will actually start sampling to select customers in the first quarter of this year , and it will continue to select in limited quantities , it will continue to sample throughout this year , with production in 2017 . Our road map will then -- we 're still working on our road map beyond that of when do we integrate the full IP into our silicon , so make a monolithic die . We 're actually spending an equal amount of time on that same kind of a road map , an MCP , or a multi-chip package , followed by a monolithic die in the IoT space .

Thanks for taking my question . On the Data Center business , it decelerated as the team has expected , but 5 % of your growth in Q4 was a bit more deceleration than what we were anticipating .

If you take a look at how the second half , which is really Q3 and Q4 looked similar , enterprise actually stabilized from the first half . So , enterprise was weak in the first half , and tended to -- got a little bit more stable in the second half . And what we saw was a normal -- the cloud guys tend to slow down in the fourth quarter , because that 's when a lot of the cloud -- they do n't want to be upsetting the cloud infrastructure while the holiday seasons are on and people are buying things . And then we continued to see strong growth and strong share gain in the networking and telco side . We 're absolutely -- we continue to look out -- and again , we 're very careful to not look at this on a quarter-by-quarter basis . We 're looking at the long view , and we 're very confident that , yes , we 'll continue into this double-digit growth in the Data Center . It will continue to be fueled by the cloud in the first side , and then secondly by our growth in telco and networking , as our share grows there .

And then we add in a workweek , in order to get back on sync . It 's a little -- it 's easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra workweek , because we 've got lights on , and factories running , and we 're paying people . The revenue associated with it is a little harder to calculate . When you look at where the week actually falls , it 's that week between Christmas and New Year 's .

So , some revenue impact ; hard to quantify it . The way I 'd look at it though , when you look at our guide , and you take out Altera , and you take into account any impact for the extra work week , what you 'd see is that the guide for the first quarter is at the low end of what we normally see from a Q4 to a Q1 , is how I 'd think of it . And then you add Altera back on top of that , and you get to the revenue number that we provided . And just to be totally transparent , the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the order of $ 400 million .

Thanks for letting me ask the question . Brian , the first question I have is on the DCG business . This quarter , the December quarter , you saw a modest drop in ASPs , both sequentially and year over year , which is somewhat of an anomaly for that business . And I guess I understand the mix shift , as cloud grows faster than enterprise . I 'm curious : Do you think this was a one-quarter anomaly ? Is this something we should expect more of , as networking grows faster in 2016 ? And within the individual segments , are you still seeing customers buy up the stack ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian Krzanich , Intel Corporation - CEO [ 42 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Jan-14", "chunk_index": 39, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-14-INTC.txt"}}

So , for Q4 , the decline , or the decrease in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the networking , as you mentioned , and the fact that the percentage of Atom in networking tends to be a bit higher . If you look at networking as a whole , the ASPs in networking tend to be lower than , say , cloud or enterprise . However , if you look at Q4 's networking ASP -- so , if you took out just that ASP , and you compared that ASP relative to prior quarters , it was actually up as an average . So , it has a lower average selling price , but that average selling price is increasing as more people buy -- and as NFV and SDN take off , more people tend to buy up to core , because they 're really searching for that performance . We do hope and expect this trend to continue into 2016 , as we gain share in networking . The relative strength -- so , then if you take a look at the cloud space and the enterprise space , we expect those to continue on the trends you 've seen over the last few years . We do n't expect any major shifts there , but we", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Jan-14", "chunk_index": 40, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-14-INTC.txt"}}

In the CFO commentary that was released , you 'll see some of this written out , so you can always refer back to it . But the change in depreciation , you 're right , in total , is about $ 1.5 billion . But only about half of that is flowing through COGS , and impacting gross margin in 2016 .

There 's a couple of things that feed into that . Units were a little weaker for us in the client segment in Q4 . As we worked our way through the Christmas selling season , what we saw is the sell-through all the way to the end customer was a little less than we thought . We made up for that with a rich mix , so that 's why we ended up with a pretty good result . But a little -- we 're watching that carefully . And then , our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what 's going on in China right now . And as you know , that 's the largest PC market . So , we 're just a little cautious on the growth rates there . In terms of from here , I think Brian said it well . We 're expecting -- this is the environment as we work our way through 2016 .

Its gross margin , that as John was saying , is a little higher than the corporate average , so it gives us a slight mix . But because it 's a relatively small business against the backdrop of Intel , it 's not a big shift in our gross margin . And then we 're expecting spending that 's at a run rate of a couple hundred million dollars a quarter . In addition to all of that , there will be a bunch of one-time acquisition deal-related costs . There 's amortization of acquisition-related intangibles . You 'll see all those in the GAAP number .

It reports directly to me , and it will be fully integrated . The sales force at the beginning , because the sales tends to be a bit more technical , and a bit more like a field sales engineering-type role , we 're keeping it separate . But that 's something we 're going to continue to evaluate . But the organization , the engineering -- already in the first two weeks , we 've had -- really for me , I 'm really pleased with the level of integration and help that we 've done to get products and road maps focused and integrated into our internal systems . So , you should expect it to be fully integrated . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mark Henninger , Intel Corporation - VP of Finance and Director of IR [ 66", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Jan-14", "chunk_index": 57, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-14-INTC.txt"}}

I 'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we 're announcing today . CCG revenue grew 2 % year-over-year . We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM , particularly in China and other emerging markets , which also led to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory . Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and a 14th workweek . The Data Center business posted another good quarter , growing 9 % over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand , partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise . The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22 % year-over-year , due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals . In the Memory business , strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines , leading to revenue that was 6 % lower year-over-year , and in our Security business , revenue grew 12 % as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution . And finally the PSG group , formerly known as Altera , got off to a great start . It delivered a revenue of $ 359 million , and after adjusting for $ 100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges , the business achieved mid-single-digit growth . And less than a quarter after the deal closed , we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form .

The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel 's primary growth engines , and combined with Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth . Last year we achieved record revenue in the Data Center , Internet of Things , and Memory businesses . We delivered a combined $ 2.2 billion in revenue growth , and made up 40 % of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating process . Today we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation . Through this initiative we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center , IoT , Memory , and FPGA businesses , and we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client business . These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017 .

We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center , Internet of Things , Non-Volatile Memory Solutions , and Programmable Solutions Groups , which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group .

The trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey . From 2013 to 2015 the PC TAM declined 10 % , yet Intel 's revenue grew 5 % , and our operating profit grew 14 % over this horizon . But as Brian mentioned , we want to accelerate that execution . In order to do that we 're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months . The goal is to come out of this more agile , more efficient , with more investment in our key growth initiatives , and more profitable . When completed by mid-2017 , these actions will result in a 12,000 person workforce reduction , and a $ 1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate . Relative to full year 2016 , we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $ 700 million to $ 20.6 billion .

I mean , if you take a look at it , so let 's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now , and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that . So we 've talked about this transformation , that we 're moving from a client-centric , you know Intel 's been typically known as the PC company , to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products , and really focused around the cloud , right ?

You take a look at it , 40 % of our revenue , 60 % of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now . It 's time to make this transition and push the Company over , all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction . So that 's why we wanted to do it now . Let 's talk then about the leadership changes . There 's really only been three leadership changes , if we just take the last couple of quarters . We had Doug Davis , he is simply retiring . Those are personal reasons . That has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the Company . It 's IoT . We 've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments . It grew 22 % this quarter . It 's clearly -- his performance in the group is strong . And he 's staying until we find a successor , roughly the end of the year , we think , something like that .

We wanted to be completely transparent , be very open about that and let everyone know . This is going to be an orderly transition . We are just going to start the search . Stacy is solid in the CFO seat in that meantime , but this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company .

Specific to the PC market , as we said in our prepared remarks , we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits , and when we started the year we were in the mid-single digits decline . The linearity , so first you have to understand , the first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers view of the market came down , and if you recall we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year . They were bringing down inventory levels , and that impacted us in Q1 and I think you 'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter , that we 'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory . We think that does n't repeat in the back half , so it 's a little bit of a tailwind . I 'd also say , you want to be careful of , we guided to mid-single digits . That 's a range .

And I always want to make sure , it 's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the client area . You know , we think that we can become more focused . There are areas of the client space that are growing . 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year . Gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year . Set-top boxes are growing , and we are gaining share in the set-top box space . So we 're doing very well in segments that are growing in the client space and the PC space .

I 'm trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full-year view . Does the team anticipate double-digits growth in DCG ?

The Memory segment , the NAND segment especially , tends to go in these cycles where there 's overcapacity in the industry , and aggressive pricing , and then it shifts back to more normal pricing , and then tight pricing , which is always very positive . So this is just a normal cycle . We think we 've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence . If I look forward , we believe the 3D NAND technology that we 're just beginning to ramp in our factories today , and we 're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup , gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments . So we 're still confident that this business will continue to grow .

When you look at where that 14th week fell , it 's a relatively light , but it certainly had some impact , so I do n't want to say none . But it 's a little hard to figure it out on any given business . It certainly had some impact on DCG though . In terms of the pricing , it 's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment . So what you would see , with a constant mix we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center , but the networking segment grew 50 % year-on-year , which is exactly consistent with our strategy , and so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Apr-19", "chunk_index": 31, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-19-INTC.txt"}}

And I always remind people that , let 's just start at the very top as , when you take a look at the Data Center , it 's not one product . It 's a family of products that really spanned from Xeon 5s that sell for several thousand dollars , to the networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times . But within each one of those families - so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing - our ASPs are increasing , and that 's mostly due to bringing in better products , people buying up the ladder in product , and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments . So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP . We have a boomer quarter like this , like Stacy talked about . Networking is a little bit higher or something like that . But if you take a look inside any one of those segments , ASPs are increasing , and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing ASP .

Thanks for letting me ask a question . My first one , I wanted to get a little more into profitability within the Data Center Group . You know revenue was down about $ 309 million sequentially . Operating profit was down $ 411 million sequentially . I know there 's lots of moving parts , you have the extra week of OpEx that might not been fully covered by revenue .

I know there 's lots of moving parts , you have the extra week of OpEx that might not been fully covered by revenue . And Stacy , you talked about in your opening comments , the 14-nanometer ramp starting to hit there . But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix , I 'm wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward ? I think it was about 44 % in the March quarter , down pretty significantly in the December quarter . Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Stacy Smith , Intel Corporation - EVP & CFO [ 46 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes , so John , you nailed it in terms of what 's going on with operating profit in Q1 . It 's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14-nanometer server product . That 's what 's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue .

First is , no , I 'm not worried that the PC will shrink to a point where the scale wo n't get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovation . In fact we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC . That 's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas .

That 's what we really tried to do with this restructuring , is take a look at the areas that are growing , that we believe we can bring innovation to , that will make a difference to the end-user . You are going to see more investments in 2-in-1s . You 're going to see more investments in thin and light devices . You 're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems , which are growing at a very fast rate , and they tend to buy up the stack to the very , very top .

First I 'll just tell you that , having been raised by Andy Grove , always paranoid about the competition , always driving , and you know that we live or die by the performance of our product . We believe that if you take a look at our road maps , we have strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have . I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much much broader than just the CPU . What we 're trying to do is really provide top of rack to bottom of rack solutions , that bring -- that work together and bring performance across the whole rack . And that starts with rack scale architecture itself , which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much more denser and lower cost way , through silicon photonics within rack communications . Then we go to 3D Xpoint . And then you have our whole CPU architecture , from networking , storage , up through server . So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint , and have everything work together and come together to bring , really , performance that", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2016-Apr-19", "chunk_index": 55, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-19-INTC.txt"}}

In the other areas , like you said , networking and storage and the telco area ? Those are areas that we 're gaining share , and as they move to software-defined infrastructure , and basically virtualized infrastructure , it plays right into the Intel architecture , and really what we do best which is general purpose computing .

As a follow-up , I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question , but perhaps Stacy , you could help us quantify what Intel started operating margins are this year , or maybe even longer term . Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies , they can get towards 20 % , 25 % operating margins , and when I look at a Foundry , a DSMC , it 's able to get close to 40 % operating margin .

So from a top line overall company standpoint , we think that there 's significant opportunity to grow .

So just to recap the financial data that we provided you , we get to that level by mid-2017 , that 's $ 1.4 billion in savings , and that is a net number , so that 's including some reinvestment that we plan to make .

If you take a look at it , first , it 's growing quite well and if you take a look at the Data Center , I mean the IoT , right now , it grew 22 % this quarter , and it has PC-like margins , so this is not cell phone chips . They do n't tend to be cell phone chips . If you take a look at the segments we 're really going after , which are things like automotive , or what I 'll call autonomous vehicles , industrial and retail , they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge . They tend to have machine learning capabilities . These are systems and they tend to have a high degree of cons , more and more will move into 5G .

The fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted , while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments . Revenue grew 2 % , or 6 % after adjusting for the McAfee transaction . Operating income grew 8 % , and earnings per share grew 26 % , both reaching all-time records . Added all together , and this was a remarkable quarter in what is shaping up to be a remarkable year . Our strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries . Our data-centric businesses are the company 's growth engine . Individually , these businesses provide great value to our customers . Collectively , they 're solving our customers ' problems in a way that no individual business or product could . We 've built a collection of capabilities that is unmatched . At the same time , our PC business remains central to our success . It 's a source of great profit , cash flow , scale and intellectual property . We 've made great progress in both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses over the last few months , and I 'll share a few important milestones that illustrate that progress .

Our focus on an annual beat rate of innovation and thoughtful segmentation , combined with an investment strategy designed to produce results even in a declining market , is paying off . We 're especially excited about the launch of our latest Eighth Generation Core processor , codenamed Coffee Lake . The Coffee Lake family includes our first 6-core desktop CPU . And it 's our best gaming processor to date , with up to 50 % better performance than the competition on top-game titles . We 're on track to ship our first low-volume 10-nanometer part by the end of the year . That will be followed by the initial ramp in the first half of 2018 , with both high volume and system availability in the second half of 2018 . We shipped our first modem into the auto industry , and our modem revenue was up 37 % in total over last year . Moving on to our data-centric businesses , DCG revenue grew 7 % in Q3 and remains on track for high single-digit growth for the year . We saw strong cloud growth outgrew the comm service provider in market . And while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially , we still see workloads moving to the cloud . Cloud and comm service provider revenue combined is nearly 60 % of DCG revenue now . In less than 3 months , we 've had more than 200 Xeon Scalable OEM systems", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-INTC.txt"}}

And our customers across all of our segments are beginning deployments that will continue to ramp in Q4 and through 2018 . In our Internet of Things business , revenue was up 23 % with strengths across the retail , industrial and video segments . We also continue to build momentum in the vehicle infotainment market , winning designs from our competitors at leading automakers . Earlier in the quarter , we closed the Mobileye transaction , a full 4 months ahead of schedule . So far this year , Mobileye has won 14 ADAS designs across 14 automakers , a pace well ahead of the 12 wins they recorded all of last year . These designs provide for typical features like automated emergency braking , lane keeping and adaptive cruise control , but several also include next step functionality like highway autonomous driving . We 're also winning marquee designs for Level 3 and higher levels of autonomy , including our strategic partnership with BMW and Fiat Chrysler . Most recently , we announced that Waymo 's newest vehicles , the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans , feature Intel-based technologies for sensor processing , general compute and connectivity . With 3 million miles of real-world driving , Waymo cars with Intel technology inside have already processed more self-driving car miles than any other autonomous fleet on the U.S. roads .

Our progress in just a few short months illustrates the benefits of our combination . And together , we can deliver the promise of autonomous driving and a safer collision-free future . Let 's move on now to memory and FPGAs . Our memory business grew 37 % over last year . And operating margin improved significantly as Fab 68 , our Dalian factory , continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal . Fab 68 accounted for more than half of our supply in the quarter , where more than 70 % of the total bits were 3D NAND . Our memory innovation and technology leadership is having an impact . We shipped the industry 's first 64-layer data center SSDs and have a strong Optane design win pipeline . That leadership technology has also resulted in strong customer interest in long-term supply agreements , and we 've already signed 2 such agreements . Bob will share more about our approach , but this is an important step that will mitigate the short-term cash flow impacts of ramping our memory capacity . And finally in our FPGA business , revenue was up 10 % over last year with growth in the data center , embedded and automotive segments , where we 're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and DENSO 's stereo vision system . Strength in these segments was partially offset by", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-INTC.txt"}}

Our design win revenue value was up more than 10 % in the third quarter , its highest level in more than 3 years . This business is essential to our success in artificial intelligence . In Q3 , Microsoft announced that it would use our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs for its accelerated deep learning platform that 's codenamed Project Brainwave . And as part of a broadening engagement between our companies , Alibaba is using Intel FPGAs to power the acceleration of the service of Alibaba Cloud . We made tremendous progress in AI and advanced computing technologies over the last few months . In addition to our FPGAs and autonomous driving wins , we launched the Movidius Myriad X , the world 's first vision processing unit with a dedicated Neural Compute Engine to deliver artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low-power , high-performance package . We also achieved new research milestones , as Intel scientists pursue exciting , emerging forms of compute . We delivered a 17-qubit superconducting test chip for quantum computing to our research partner , QuTech , and we 'll follow that up with a 49-qubit test chip by the end of the year . We also unveiled the Loihi , a self-learning test chip that mimics the brain 's basic mechanics and makes machine learning faster and more efficient .

I also announced last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us , sharing their technical insights as we bring this new generation of AI hardware to market . Together , these accomplishments reinforce several things for me . First , Intel is the leader in AI inference from the core of the data center to autonomous vehicles , out to the edge devices where low power is especially critical . Second , artificial intelligence takes many forms and will require computing solutions that are tailored for the workload , the environment and the user , rather than a one-size-fits-all . And third , our investments and pipeline of innovation position us to lead for years to come . We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of . And I 'd like to take a moment to remember our former CEO and my friend , Paul Otellini . Paul had an enormous impact on the industry and this company , and his Intel family will miss him . He would be proud of our growing momentum , and it 's an important part of his legacy . Wrapping things up , I 'm excited about both our progress and our prospects .

Versus the expectations we set out at the beginning of the quarter , our revenue is better , our gross margins were stronger and our spending was lower . As Brian said , we 're on track for another record in 2017 . Revenue in the quarter was $ 16.1 billion , up 6 % year-over-year , excluding McAfee , and we achieved record earnings . Operating income was $ 5.6 billion , up 8 % year-over-year . And EPS was $ 1.01 , up 26 % year-over-year . From a capital allocation perspective , we closed the Mobileye transaction and funded a significant portion of the purchase price through the sale of noncore assets , including reducing our position in ASML and proceeds from the partial exit at McAfee . Additionally , we signed long-term NAND supply agreements providing more than $ 2 billion in prepayments through 2018 , significantly improving free cash flow for our memory business . We generated $ 6.3 billion in cash flow from operations , and we returned $ 2.4 billion to shareholders . At our Analyst Day in February , we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company . Our Q3 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation . Intel 's data-centric businesses , those outside of the PC segment , grew 15 % year-over-year and now represent 45 % of our revenue , up from approximately 30 % in 2012 .

This collection of businesses is well positioned to capitalize on industry trends , create great value for our customers and represents the company 's growth engine going forward . Our PC-centric business generated flat revenue in the quarter and improved operating margin by over 3 points . The CCG team continues to execute extremely well in a declining PC TAM environment . Our focus on performance-leading products and a smart segmentation strategy is working . This business provides scale , funds IP and generates a significant portion of the company 's profits and cash flows . Moving to earnings . We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter , up 26 % year-on-year . Our EPS improvement was driven by solid platform execution , strong growth from our adjacent products and businesses and lower spending , resulting in $ 408 million growth in operating income . Additionally , we continued to monetize some of our ICAP Portfolio position , resulting in a gain of $ 0.13 per share . We made a commitment at the beginning of the year to reduce spending to 30 % of revenue by 2020 at the latest , while continuing to invest in key growth areas and capabilities . We are making great progress . Total spending was down 6 % year-over-year in the third quarter .

We 've continued investments in our key priorities , including driving Moore 's Law forward , artificial intelligence and autonomous driving . At the same time , we 're executing with operational discipline and generating significant leverage from higher revenue growth . Our R & D spending as a percent of revenue was flat , and our SG & A costs were down 3 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant leverage in our G & A functions . In addition , we made changes to our co-marketing programs to provide more flexibility and efficiency to our customers . These changes resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $ 200 million during the quarter , reducing year-over-year growth in CCG by approximately 2 points and DCG by just over 0.5 point , with a corresponding reduction in spending . These changes collectively have no impact on operating income . The impact of these changes will continue into Q4 at a slightly increased level . On a full year basis , we expect direct spending to be approximately 33 % , 1 point better than our prior guidance and down over 2 full points from last year . Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on Slide 5 . The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter . Revenue of $ 8.9 billion was flat year-over-year and operating margins grew by 3 points . Flat revenue was driven by client ASPs up 7 % , unit volume down 7 % and our adjacency business up 15 % , partially offset by the changes to our co-marketing program .

This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating income growing 8 % from strong core mix , continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit cost and lower spending . The Data Center Group had revenue of $ 4.9 billion , up 7 % year-over-year . And operating income of $ 2.3 billion grew 7 % . Q3 operating margin was 46 % . As Brian mentioned earlier , we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service providers segments , which are nearly 60 % of our DCG revenue . Overall unit volume was up 4 % , ASPs were up 2 % and adjacencies grew 16 % . We launched Purley in Q3 , and in less than 3 months , we 've had more than 200 OEM systems begin production shipments . Revenue scale from leadership products and spending leverage and efficiency drove strong operating income growth for the business . We expect DCG to meet our full year expectations of high single-digit growth and operating margin percent in the low 40s .

We closed the Mobileye transaction early August , 4 months sooner than we expected . The Mobileye team executed extremely well in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations with $ 82 million in revenue and $ 39 million in operating income . Going forward , results for the Mobileye acquisition will be included in our all other segment . Increases in spending in this segment will correspond with reductions in the IoTG segment as we realize cost synergies from this acquisition .

Our cash position of $ 17.5 billion at September 30 is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year , but we 've had lots of moving pieces during the year . First , we have generated $ 7.2 billion in free cash flow year-to-date .

The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook and lower spending . The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue , coupled with gains on the sale of our equity investments .

So let 's talk about this . We can kind of break this down . So first , we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that number -- as I said , we lead in inference , which is the actual application of artificial intelligence , and we 're continuing to really grow in that space . I think AI , if you take look at , in general , machine learning , it 's the smallest segment or workload , if you look at the data center , but the fastest growing . So you 're going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business . You 're seeing the effects in our numbers already around Xeon , Xeon Scalable , the FPGAs . We talked about Microsoft Brainwave 's launch that 's occurring .

And also at the lower end outside the data center , things like Movidius and now Mobileye , you 're seeing those hit our P & L as well real-time now as we speak . The other products like Nervana , you 'll start to see really more towards the back end probably of 2018 from a P & L perspective . If you take a look at Nervana , it actually -- we get our first silicon out . It will be handed out as test silicons . We have a yearly cadence of products . And so I expect the first instantiations to be more people , figuring out how to use it . It wo n't be a big impact . But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and get the second generation and beyond , that will grow , we believe , quite considerably . And then products like Loihi , which is our neuromorphic , are same thing . That part we put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic , which is a very different type of machine learning . It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rate than traditional , I 'll say , GPUs and CPUs , especially around visual learning .

And then the follow-up question I had was actually for Bob , and it 's on the OpEx side . And congrats on the great operating leverage in the quarter . As we think about the way you can get that operating leverage in the past , Intel seems to have focused mainly on keeping the OpEx relatively flat , and then revenue growth driving that leverage . But in the quarter and then the guide that you just delivered , it looks like OpEx is down about 6 % year-over-year .

First , as you mentioned , we had great progress in the third quarter . We kind of started the year at a spending level which was a little over 35 % of revenue . And we came into 2017 saying that we would get that down to roughly 34 % . Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33 % .

And we 're not to redeploy that capital or to get it out of the ecosystem . So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly $ 700 million on a business that will be roughly $ 2.5 billion bigger in the second half versus the first half . So we 're making great progress and making real trade-offs on our spending levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth .

First , because you 've kind of got a couple of questions in there , the way I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started . It starts with the big comm service providers . You saw Google talk about it a couple of weeks ago . You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week . Those ramps are just beginning . I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers . Those are starting to come out . So we are really early .

This is going to be -- take a year or more . So it 's -- I think it 's early to make this judgment . The ramp 's right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product . Your second part of your question is 7 % high single digits . I will just make it simple and say , look , if you look , mathematically , I think it would meet a minima of high single digits , but it 's certainly not necessarily where we 're targeting to get to , but it 's a high single-digit number .

Obviously , PC is a significant part of that . Memory is growing faster . IoT is growing faster . PSG and data center -- PSG faster in the second half versus the first half , and DCG in line with our full year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits . So real good strength on clients , on memory , on IoT and in line with the other businesses . The other thing I would just offer to -- follow up on Brian 's commentary on DCG growth -- maybe 2 things . One , we started out at 6 % in Q1 . We were at 9 % in Q2 . We 're at 7 % in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double-digit growth in the third quarter . So I would say from a top line perspective , we 're right in line with kind of the guide that we gave at the end of the year . And secondly and as importantly , our operating margins has continued to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter through the course of the year , with 46 % operating margins in the third quarter . And we told you early on despite a relatively slow start , we expect that operating margin for DCG to be above 40 % for the year , and we 're well", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-INTC.txt"}}

Maybe for my follow-up for Brian , Brian , I know this is not a big part of your growth strategy going forward . But as you mentioned in your prepared comments , CCG is still very important to scale advantages , to profitability , to free cash flow , to your ability to invest in growth markets . And that 's been a business that 's been sort of remarkably stable over the last 4 or 5 quarters . It 's grown over the last couple of years , in part because we 've had relatively easy compares in the PC market . So I 'm kind of curious as you think about this business over the next , call it 4 to 8 quarters , how are you guys thinking about the corporate upgrade cycle or refresh cycle on PCs , the consumer refresh cycle , the gaming market , and I guess importantly , the modem business , which is becoming a bigger and bigger part of this business over time ? Do you think you can still keep this business sort of on a flat growth trajectory ? Or how are you thinking about it ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brian M.

So you 've captured that quite well , right ? Let 's just talk about there -- we can talk about it from a unit standpoint and then we can talk about it from how has our business done . From a unit standpoint , the decline has certainly slowed down , right ? We -- if you go back a year or 2 ago , we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year-over-year from a unit basis . And that slowed into the low single digits that we 're seeing today , but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level . And I always remind people , we 've taken probably something like 25 % of the annual units out of this business , yet grown in that time frame the profitability of that business significantly . So that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that , that team , at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant , have really delivered to the company .

And that improvement is really a function of 3 things : one , earnings growth , more operating earnings growth as opposed to the ICAP gains , but real solid operating earnings growth ; secondly , we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $ 12 billion to $ 11.5 billion this year ; and third , we -- the long-term agreements that we signed in the year . One of the benefits on what we 're trying to do is really match our net capital deployed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and partners , which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business that makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us .

In Q4 , we generated $ 20.2 billion in revenue and $ 1.52 in earnings per share , exceeding our guidance by $ 1 billion and $ 0.28 , respectively . For the full year , we delivered $ 72 billion in revenue and $ 4.87 in EPS . The PC , Data Center , IoT , Memory and Mobileye businesses each set all-time annual revenue records . Several years ago , we began a transformation to reposition the company to take advantage of the data revolution that is reshaping computing . Exiting this quarter , we now have greater than 50 % of our revenue coming from our data-centric collection of businesses , but our journey is just beginning . To reach our multiyear goals , we will continuously focus on 3 key priorities : accelerating growth , improving execution and deploying our capital for attractive returns . I 'd like to share our progress against these priorities over the last 90 days . We are accelerating growth by expanding the capabilities of our workload-optimized platforms , playing a larger role in our customers ' success . Demand for our Intel Xeon Scalable processors is very strong as customers continue to make Xeon the foundation for their AI-infused data center workloads . One of the reasons Cascade Lake is our fastest-ramping Xeon CPU is its unrivaled AI performance . Xeon 's AI performance will take another step in the first half of 2020 when our third generation Xeon Scalable processor , Cooper Lake , debuts .

In addition to strengthening our largest businesses , we 're investing to win key data-driven technology inflections . These inflections include the rise of artificial intelligence , the transformation of networks and emergence of the intelligent and autonomous edge . The market for AI-based silicon is growing and evolving quickly . New workloads are emerging , and existing workloads like high-performance computing are converging with AI . In 2019 , we generated $ 3.8 billion in AI-based revenue . The AI market opportunity is expected to be $ 25 billion by 2024 , and we 're investing to lead with a strong portfolio of products . In addition to integrating AI into all our leading products , we 've introduced and acquired new capabilities that deepen an already unparalleled portfolio of AI assets . We announced the acquisition of Habana Labs , a leading developer of programmable , deep learning accelerators for the data center . Habana , combined with Intel 's existing AI ASICs and software expertise , will advance our AI offerings for the data center with high-performance training and inference processors and a standards-based programming environment to address evolving AI workloads . Delivering the optimal AI silicon architecture is critical but not sufficient to solve customers ' problems . That 's why we launched the oneAPI industry initiative to deliver a unified and simplified programming model for application development across heterogeneous processing architectures . oneAPI marks a game-changing evolution from today 's limiting proprietary program approaches to an open standard space model for cross-architecture developer engagement and innovation . As expected , our networking business reached $ 5 billion in revenue in 2019 .

We also continued to accelerate the commercialization of driverless mobility as a service with 2 new partnerships , RATP in Paris and Daegu City in South Korea . In Q4 , we were also excited to host analyst and investors at Mobileye 's headquarters to discuss our strategy to win the more than $ 70 billion opportunity for ADAS , AV and data , and to expand our aspirations to an even larger role in the $ 160 billion opportunity for Mobility as a Service . Our guests had the chance to test drive our technology on the demanding roads of Jerusalem as we demonstrated industry 's leading AV solution stack navigating a wide variety of driving complexities and delivering unmatched agility and safety . We have significant opportunities , but realizing them requires improved execution , starting with delivering more supply for our customers . In response to continued strong demand , we invested record levels of CapEx in 2018 and 2019 . That added capacity allowed us to increase our second half 2019 PC CPU supply by double digits relative to the first half . However , demand has continued to outpace PC supply , and supply remains tight in our PC business . We 're continuing to add capacity , so we 're not constraining our customers ' growth .

And Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 31 % and 54 % , respectively , driven by the industry-leading EyeQ products , which offer unmatched computer vision and mapping capabilities and continue to win in a fast-growing ADAS market . EyeQ revenue was up 41 % year-over-year . NSG revenue grew 10 % on continued bit growth , partially offset by year-over-year pricing declines . NSG reported an operating loss of $ 96 million as NAND cost improvements were more than offset by pricing declines . PSG revenue declined 17 % year-over-year on softness in the embedded segment primarily driven by lower last-time buys versus Q4 '18 , partially offset by strength in wireless . Operating income was down 48 % on lower revenue and segment product mix . CCG revenue was $ 10 billion in the fourth quarter , up 2 % year-over-year , driven by higher PC and modem volumes . PC unit volumes were up 1 % on continued market strength and increased capacity . Adjacencies , which include modems and wireless and wired connectivity solutions , grew 13 % year-over-year driven by strong demand for modems and a better mix of connectivity solutions . Operating margin was 41 % , up 4 points year-on-year on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exit .

We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up high single digits for the full year as we capitalize on the secular trends that Bob outlined . We are expecting an exceptionally strong Q1 as cloud customers continue to build capacity and adopt our highest-performing products . This would mark 3 quarters of strong cloud buildout , and we expect more modest capacity expansion for the remainder of the year as CSPs move to a digestion phase . We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move through the year . As a result of these dynamics , we expect total revenue to be more front-end loaded in the first half than we 've seen historically . Gross margin is expected to be 59 % for the year , down a point versus 2019 on both mix of products and the impact of 10-nanometer costs . Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $ 19 billion or 26 % of revenue , down 1 point , resulting in a flat operating margin of approximately 33 % . We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $ 17 billion . More than half of which is comprised of investments in fab space and 7- and 5-nanometer equipment . Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $ 16.5 billion as the flow-through from revenue growth and higher depreciation is offset by higher CapEx and rebuilding of critical product inventory back to more normal operating levels .

But it appears by the end of this year , you could even be going negative in both of those segments year-over-year . So it seems like it 's a pretty significant drop .

When we look at 2020 demand cycles , we kind of have 3 things going on that are -- that impact the first half to second half outlook . And George touched on a few of these . But first , at the macro level , the insatiable appetite for data and the processing resources that need to go to make that data relevant , those trends continue , and we feel very good about how we 're positioned to capitalize on this increased demand . Second , the -- as you know , from a cloud perspective , which now is bigger and bigger part of our overall DCG revenue , we expect them to continue to benefit from the trajectories that I mentioned initially . At the same time , you 'll remember from last year , our ability to predict the cloud -- the CSPs ' purchasing and then kind of digestion patterns is relatively hard . So we look at first half to second half , Q1 will be the , in essence , the third quarter in a row of real strong consumption patterns from the cloud folks . So we know from history that at some point , they go into digestion mode and the buying patterns begin to slow down . And it does n't impact medium- or long-term trends , but it does impact cyclical trends during the course of the year .

But at this stage of the game , that 's kind of how we 've looked at cloud purchases first half to the second half . The second thing , PC TAM , we think , is going to be flat to down a little bit this year . And the expectation is the first half will continue to be a Windows 10 refresh that George flagged , and we expect that to slow down in the second half . And then the third item is modem . It 's -- as we go into the second half of the year , we expect modem volume to be lower as we phase out of that business , as smartphone modem moves to the 5G world . So those 3 things have us looking at the full year of kind of 2 % growth . And inherent in that is we know we got a much more competitive environment . And our intention during the course of the year is to compete vigorously to protect our position while continuing to expand as compute moves further and further away from the cloud out to the network and to the edge . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- George S.

So we feel very good exiting the year and coming into this year and where we are in yields . Second , in terms of the product road map , we have -- we launched Ice Lake for client in the fourth quarter . We launched FPGA 's Agilex products on 10-nanometer in the fourth quarter . And then through the course of this year , we 're going to have successive products as AI inference accelerator , 5G SoC that we 're really excited about for the 5G network GPU launched . And then last and certainly not least , bringing out Ice Lake server product at the back end of the year . So we 've launched it . Yields are good . Designs across our portfolio of products are good , and we 'll ramp them up during the course of the year . But primarily , in terms of volume , we 'll still be -- the client business is the one we 're going to ramp the fastest . It 'll ramp during the course of the year .

If you just sort of look at the Q1 guide of 61 % versus the full year of 59 % , I 'm just trying to understand kind of the puts and takes that brings gross margin down throughout the year . And explicitly , how much of this is kind of you guys baking in some increased competition ? Or how much of this is a pull forward of 7-nanometer ?

At the highest level , what you 're really seeing is the -- an impact of -- largely related to 10-nanometer costs that are coming into the system during this year and increasing as we go into the second half for all the reasons that Bob laid out . We 're actually getting some help that is moderating the impact of that from improving NAND pricing year-over-year .

And in Q1 , what you 're really seeing is lower modem and lower variable comp being the reason that we 're moving up a point , say , from Q4 . And so nothing unusual other than , normally , you would have expected to see a much bigger drop in Q1 gross margin because of the mix of products as it 's the , obviously , the seasonally down quarter for many of our businesses . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert H.

I think last quarter , we were talking about 60 % for this year , and we 're now 59 % for the year on a little bit better revenue . And yes , it 's only 100 basis points less . But obviously , people are concerned about the competitive environment . So can you just talk specifically to what changed ?

Tim , let me just kind of correct the history just a little bit . What we said over the last couple of quarters was , when the question was , hey , when we look at 58 % , which is what we quoted for Q4 , does that mean -- is that the number that we should be expecting for 2020 and also with the 57 % on the table for '21 , is that where we are ? And I said we will be closer to 60 % than we will be to either of those numbers . And so 59 % is very much", "metadata": {"company": "INTC", "date": "2020-Jan-23", "chunk_index": 52, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jan-23-INTC.txt"}}

So I do n't really feel like we 're down a point . But clearly , there -- the factors that we talked about , everything from product mix to 10-nanometer mix , those are all things that are having an effect , particularly as the year plays out , and also the shape of the year . Bob talked about some of the things where we 're -- we 'll be in -- the mix in the first half is going to be much richer than we would normally have seen , and we may see a little less rich mix in the second half . So I think really nothing more than those type of movements , which are very much in line with what we were thinking we would see this year . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert H.

We feel great about how we wrapped up the year , our best quarter in the company 's history , 2019 , the best year in our company 's history , and our outlook for 2020 is it 'll -- is we 'll do it again . We expect it to be another record year . And our ambitions have just never been greater . As you know , we 're going after a larger TAM . We 're expanding the role that we play in our customers ' success . We 're leveraging our CPU architecture but also evolving beyond the CPU to GPUs and visual processing units as workloads continue to evolve . And given the overall dynamics of the industry , we feel very good about where we stand and we realize it 's an increasingly competitive world , and we feel like we 're well positioned to deal with it . So thanks again for joining us . Our focus is on obsessing about how we serve our customers best .
