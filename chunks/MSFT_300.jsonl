This quarter , we delivered $ 24.7 billion in revenue , up 10 % in constant currency . For the year , we are $ 96.7 billion in revenue , up 5 % . I 'm proud of the progress , particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results . FY '17 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud , AI and digital transformation . Our technology worldview of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge is resonating with businesses everywhere . Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability . Microsoft is that trusted partner . Now let 's look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment , starting with Productivity and Business Process . The workplace is transforming , from changing employee expectations , a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams and increasingly complex threat environment . Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work . Earlier this month , we introduced Microsoft 365 , which brings together Office 365 , Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security in a complete , secure solution to empower employees , safeguard businesses and simplify IT management .

Earlier this month , we introduced Microsoft 365 , which brings together Office 365 , Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security in a complete , secure solution to empower employees , safeguard businesses and simplify IT management . Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design , build and go to market to address customer needs . Fortune 500 customers FedEx , Dow Chemicals , Staples , Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365 . The success of our secure productive enterprise offering with its triple-digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes . We continue to see strong growth of Office 365 , with customers like Nissan , Quicken Loans , KeyBanc , Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365 . And importantly , customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher-value workloads . For example , we have seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage , which nearly doubled year-over-year . The classroom is also transforming . This quarter , we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for education , the digital hub for students and teachers . Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments . With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students , share materials , manage assignments , Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love the most : teaching .

We are investing in LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth . We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform , with sessions up more than 20 % for the third consecutive quarter . And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform . We launched a new messaging overlay , resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn , and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world . On top of that , Talent Solutions saw record-level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter . I 've talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn . Earlier this month , we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution , bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics , as well as Dynamics 365 solution for retail and talent . In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process , we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern modular business applications that are infused with AI . We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications , build new ones using Dynamics 365 , Power BI , Power Apps and Microsoft Flow . A global health care solution provider and partner , Indegene , is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales .

Now let 's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment . Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $ 18.9 billion . This quarter 's cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over 2 years ago of $ 20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018 . More than ever before , customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft Cloud . Azure revenue accelerated this quarter , growing 97 % year-over-year . CIOs and business decision-makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy . They value our hybrid consistency , developer productivity , AI capabilities and trusted approach . And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity , as we have done with our South Africa data center expansion , bringing Azure to 40 regions globally , more than any other cloud provider . And as part of our commitment to trust , we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR-compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline .

And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide . The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage . It all starts with having the support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database , Cosmos DB , Data Warehouse , Data Lake , combined with SQL Server . Azure Cosmos DB is industry 's first globally distributed database service . It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance , from IoT to AI to mobile and much more . Retailer jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day . Customers are infusing AI into their products and services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as bot framework and cognitive services . Sabre , a leading technology provider to the global travel industry , is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers ; and Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our cognitive services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent , seamless experience across online and in their stores .

Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way , whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge , so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs . Now I 'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing . Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem , I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter . Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work . Increasingly , commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure modern workplace . Enterprise and education deployments increased 33 % over the last quarter as companies like NASCAR , Emirates Airline , BMW Group , Bank of China all adopt Windows 10 . This quarter , we introduced Windows 10 S , streamlined for simplicity , security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom . Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer , Asus , Dell , Fujitsu , HP , Samsung and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jul-20", "chunk_index": 9, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jul-20-MSFT.txt"}}

We also introduced the Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device category . Now on to gaming . Our gaming business now is more than $ 9 billion and growing profitably . The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before , from gameplay across multiple devices to the explosive growth in streaming and e-sports to new subscription services and mixed-reality scenarios . We 're uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live , now 53 million strong and growing , and to enable new experiences across PC , console and mobile . Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want with the people they want on the device they want . At E3 , we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X , broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world 's most powerful console . We launched 2 new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience , both of which are off to a very strong start .

This quarter , revenue was $ 24.7 billion , up 9 % and 10 % in constant currency , with stronger-than-expected performance across all segments . Gross margin grew 11 % and 12 % in constant currency . Operating income increased 13 % and 16 % in constant currency . And earnings per share was $ 0.98 , increasing 42 % and 43 % in constant currency , which includes $ 0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously nondeductible . At a company level , LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth . LinkedIn 's operating loss of $ 361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth and is entirely attributable to the $ 371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx . From a geographic perspective , our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends , though large markets like the U.S. , Germany and Japan performed better than we expected . We had a strong quarter in our commercial business , reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year .", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jul-20", "chunk_index": 12, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jul-20-MSFT.txt"}}

Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92 % from strength across all services .

Other income and expense was $ 215 million , more than originally planned , as we continued to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter . Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6 % , significantly lower than we expected due to a $ 1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years ' losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred .

The key trends for FY '18 from the financial analyst briefing remain largely unchanged . For the full year , we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact , assuming current rates remain stable . In our Commercial business , we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix . Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline , driven by the transition to the cloud .

You should think about our FY '18 operating expenses in 2 categories : first , organic Microsoft expenses , which we expect to grow between 3 % and 4 % , reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth ; second , LinkedIn . We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth . Additionally , we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses , including $ 620 million of amortization expense .

One is , you mentioned that maybe part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals . Does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush ? In other words , it might have been a bit of a onetime phenomenon ? Secondly , is Microsoft doing anything different around contract structure or invoicing to -- that would result in bookings being unusually high , maybe collecting a little bit more up front ?

Next , I think across every service , the momentum we 've seen in Q4 -- and in particular , I would say I think not many people focus on it , but even things like Windows , E5 , Advanced Threat Protection services , those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings . One of the things we often talk about is we sell Microsoft 365 . That 's Windows 10 with security and services . It 's a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 . It includes EMS . We really did see strength across all of them . So I do n't really think it 's about a percentage but it 's about each of them continuing to make progress . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 21 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jul-20", "chunk_index": 37, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jul-20-MSFT.txt"}}

And so that 's helped us , in fact , come up with Microsoft 365 as this very strong offering that brings together Office 365 , Windows 10 as well as our Enterprise Mobility + Security and support even cross-platform devices . So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows , but also people who use phones of iOS and Android , but they need both productivity , creativity , security across all of this estate of theirs . And that 's where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition . So that 's what Microsoft 365 embodies . It 's today available in -- for enterprises , and in the fall you will have the mid-market version of it , which I think is another very big opportunity , because it really helps take what we have learned in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute .

Windows annuity growth was very good . That 's in the KPI Windows commercial products and services , is the place you 'll look and see that number .

First of all , we do n't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud . In other words , this intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture or pattern for which we are building , whether it 's SQL Server 2017 or with Windows Server , the Container Service . Everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed . And it turns out that it 's helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift , shift , modernize as to what they run in their data centers or in our data centers but also forward-looking new workloads . If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud is cloud applications that actively require an edge .

It 's actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely of this as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications that I , quite frankly , feel very , very good about leading . And so in that context , our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts .

So there 's a lot of richness there . The layer above that , for me , is the data estate .

The way I tend to think about it is , with any service , you want the gross margin itself to improve . And that includes , in the Azure services , components themselves .

On our website , Microsoft.com/investor , you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck , which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today 's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures . Unless otherwise specified we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call . The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for , or superior to , the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP . They 're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company 's fourth-quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had on financial results . Additionally , any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q ,", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

Additionally , any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q , which include research and development , sales and marketing , and general administrative , but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges . As a reminder , in May we announced plans to further streamline the phone hardware business . During the fourth quarter , restructuring and related impairment expenses were $ 1.1 billion . All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted . We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed , excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations . At the segment level , we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin . However , due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings , we 're not able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently can not derive constant currency segment operating income either . We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the Company-wide level .

I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year . We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth . Today Amy and I will share our fourth-quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead . We delivered $ 22.6 billion in revenue this quarter , an increase of 5 % for the quarter in constant currency . This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation . Our progress is best captured in the results of our three ambitions , starting with productivity and business process . In a world of infinite information but finite attention in time we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology . In pursuit of this ambition , we continue to add value to our products , grow usage and increase our addressable market . Along these lines , let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365 . In the last quarter we advanced our collaboration tools . We launched Microsoft Planner which helps teams manage operations , as well as Skype meetings which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate . In June , we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management . Lastly , we continue to add intelligence and machine learning to Office to help people out automate their tasks and glean insights from data . These advancements help to drive increased usage across enterprises , small and medium businesses and consumers .

In the enterprise , Office 365 commercial feeds grew 45 % year-over-year and revenue grew 59 % in constant currency . Also , 70 % of our Office enterprise agreement renewals are in the Cloud . Innovative companies like Facebook , Hershey 's , Discovery Communications , Cushman Wakefield , all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business . We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5 , which includes powerful security controls , advanced analytics and Cloud Voice . These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads . We see momentum in small and medium businesses with a growing number of partners selling Office 365 , now up to nearly 90,000 , a 25 % increase year-over-year . We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months . We also see momentum amongst consumers with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers . Across segments , customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices . In fact , we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices , up more than four times over last year .

Now let 's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition , Dynamics 365 . We 're removing any impedance that existed between productivity , collaboration and business process . This month we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource . Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications . These applications have intelligence built in . They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365 . Dynamics 365 , along with AppSource and our rich application platform , introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model , so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need . The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we 're already seeing in this business . Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation , including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather . Overall , Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid seats , up more than 20 % year-over-year and Q4 billings grew more than 20 % year-over-year . Overall , business processes represent an enormous addressable market projected to be more than $ 100 billion by 2020 . It 's a market we 're increasingly focused on and I believe we 're poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners .

Lastly , with Office 365 and Dynamics 365 , we have the opportunity to connect the world 's professional cloud and the world 's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal . Overall , the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support . With more than $ 12 billion in commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate , we are on track to achieve our goal of $ 20 billion in FY18 . Also , nearly 60 % of the Fortune 500 companies have at least three of our Cloud offerings . And we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business . In fact , commercial annuity mix increased year-over-year to 83 % . Now let 's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud , an area of massive opportunity as we are clearly one of the two enterprise cloud leaders . Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and turn to Microsoft . As a result , Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100 % this quarter . We see customers choose Microsoft for three reasons . They want a cloud provider that offers solutions that reflect the realities of today 's world and their enterprise grade needs .

Multinationals choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyper scale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions . We cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America . Our cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions and jurisdictions . More than 80 % of the world 's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership support for regulatory requirements , advanced security and commitment to privacy . Large ISVs like SAP and Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr also choose Azure because of our global reach and our broad set of platform services Last week GE announced it will adopt our Cloud for its IoT approach . Next , Azure customers also value our unique higher level services . Now with 33,000 , we nearly doubled in one year the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility Solutions . The Dow Chemical Company leverages EMS along with Azure , Office 365 and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure real time access to data and apps from anywhere .

Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive services . Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine-learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics . Customers like Jabil Circuit , Fruit of the Loom , Land O'Lakes , Libaire , already realize the benefits of these new capabilities . Lastly , central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice . The new Azure Container Service , as well as .NET core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat , Docker , Mesosphere , reflects significant progress on this front . We continue to see traction from open source with nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux . On the server side , premium server revenue grew double digits in constant currency year-over-year . New SQL Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance . More than 15,000 customers , including over 50 % of the Fortune 500 , have registered for the private preview of SQL Server for Linux . And we 're not slowing down . We will launch Windows Server 2016 and System 7 Server 2016 later this year .

We will launch Windows Server 2016 and System 7 Server 2016 later this year . Now let 's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing . We 've increased Windows 10 monthly active devices and are now at more than 350 million . This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release . While we are proud of these results , given changes to our phone plan , we changed how we will assess progress . Going forward , we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices , in addition to progress on three aspects of our Windows strategy . First , deliver more value and innovation , particularly for enterprise customers . Second , grow new monetization through services across our unified Windows platform . Third , innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs . Let me walk through each . We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows . In two weeks , we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update which takes a significant step forward in security . We 're also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge . We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10 , particularly in the enterprise in the coming year . We already have strong traction with over 96 % of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10 .

Next , as we grow our install base in engagement , we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem . Ink profitability continues to grow with greater than 40 % of the search revenue in June from Windows 10 devices . Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22 % this quarter , not including volume from AOL and Yahoo . The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users , with 8 billion questions asked to date . We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox Live across Windows 10 , IoS and Android . Just this quarter we launched our Minecraft Realm subscription on Android and IoS . Overall engagement on Xbox live is at record levels with more than 49 million monthly active users , up 33 % year-over-year . At E3 we announced our biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs and we announced Xbox Play Anywhere titles where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One . We also announced two new members of the Xbox One console family , the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio . The Windows Store continues to grow with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America , Roku , Cirrus FM , Instagram , Facebook , Wine , Hulu and popular PC games like Quantum Break .

Microsoft 's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth and we 're reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners . We recently announced new Surface enterprise initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton , to enable more customer segments . Also in the past year , we grew our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000 . Lastly , this quarter more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience two entirely new device categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens . While we are still in the early days of both of these devices , we are seeing great traction with both enterprise customers and developers , making us optimistic about future growth . In closing , I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us . Simply put , businesses will not just use digital technologies , but they will become digital companies . This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners .

This quarter revenue was $ 22.6 billion , up 2 % and 5 % in constant currency . Gross margin was flat , but up 4 % in constant currency . Operating income this quarter declined by 3 % and grew 6 % in constant currency . And Earnings Per Share was $ 0.69 , increasing 11 % year-over-year , or 27 % in constant currency . Across most markets our execution and results were generally as expected with some strength in the US .

Healthy renewals helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency . Our total annuity mix reached 83 % , up 1 point year-over-year . While our commercial Cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall , we also had better than expected transactional revenue performance , as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume . The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year . On that base , our commercial bookings increased 4 % in constant currency , driven by customer preference for our Cloud offers . Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $ 24.6 billion , or 8 % growth in constant currency . Our contracted-not-billed balance exceeded $ 25.5 billion . As Satya called out earlier , our commercial Cloud annualized revenue run-rate exceeded $ 12.1 billion , growing more than 50 % year-over-year . Additionally , more than 70 % of customers who signed enterprise agreements this quarter attached Cloud offerings . Our commercial Cloud gross margin was 42 % , declining year-over-year , driven by investments for cloud capacity , deployment , and support . Now let 's turn to Company gross margin performance . We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately $ 200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our phone hardware business .

Importantly , gross margin dollars expanded year-over-year in constant currency . In Q4 , the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations . FX had a 3-point negative impact on productivity and business processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a 2-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results . As we 've noted in previous quarters , we 're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income .

At the Company level , our operating income grew 6 % in constant currency as FX had a 9-point impact on our results . Now let 's turn to each segment .

Office consumer revenue increased 19 % , and 18 % in constant currency , outperforming the consumer PC market , driven by seat growth , recurring subscription revenue and 6 points of growth from Japan , which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago . And our Dynamics business grew 6 % , up 7 % in constant currency , with strong billings and seat growth . Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4 % in constant currency .

Operating expenses grew 6 % from investments in commercial cloud sales programs and engineering . As a result , operating income declined 5 % . The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $ 6.7 billion in revenue , growing 7 % and 10 % in constant currency .

Our total OEM business grew 11 % this quarter , outperforming the overall PC market , which was better than we expected in most markets including the US , the UK and Germany , partially offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia . OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27 % and , similar to last quarter , was driven by a higher mix of premium devices . OEM Pro revenue grew 2 % , reflecting a stabilizing commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro . Inventory across both OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels . Windows volume licensing grew 3 % and 9 % in constant currency with ongoing annuity growth . IP licensing declined , impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit .

Segment gross margin dollars declined 3 % or roughly flat in constant currency as decreases due to Xbox consoles and the phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results . Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13 % , based primarily on reduced phone spend and the transition of display advertising cells to AOL , resulting in segment operating income growth of 59 % . Now back to our overall Company results . We invested $ 3.1 billion in capital expenditures , consistent with our plan for accelerated investment as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet near term and longer term customer demand .

Before turning to next quarter 's outlook , I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year . My commentary , both on the year and next quarter , does not include LinkedIn . However , we still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter . For the full year we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year , assuming current rates remain stable . In H1 we expect a total impact of 1 point , reducing to zero in H2 . The fundamentals of our commercial business remain strong and we anticipate that Cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high annuity mix . As I 've noted before , our commercial transactional business is influenced by different dynamics . Most important , it 's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads . But it 's also more sensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets . We expect volatility , as we saw in both Q3 and Q4 this year , to continue in the next fiscal year .

Before discussing our total Company gross margin expectations , let me first address commercial Cloud gross margin . We expect the commercial Cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal year . We have invested heavily to build share , expand geographically and ensure world class support and reliability for our commercial customers . Going forward , we expect those investments to provide benefits of scale . We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow . Given seasonality and revenue mix , commercial cloud gross margin will see variability quarter-to-quarter but an overall trend of material improvement . At the Company level , as each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin percentage , our Company gross margin should only decline roughly a point in FY17 . We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $ 31.1 billion to $ 31.4 billion as we continue to prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities . Lastly , our effective tax rate ; our tax rate is impacted by three factors : the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue , the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests . As our Cloud continues to gain momentum , we expect our tax rate to increase .

Moving workloads onto Azure . And then for Amy . Thank you for the additional detail on the cloud gross margin profile on a going forward basis . When we dig into just Azure , you said in the past that you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we 're seeing in Amazon web services . Does that commentary still hold ?

Let me start on the first one . You 're absolutely right that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also in some form an ISV . And that 's no longer just limited to people who are quote-unquote in the classic tech industry or the software business . That 's the same case with GE , it 's the same case with Boeing , it 's the same case with Seider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with , because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure . And that 's something that we will in fact have distribution agreements with . And AppSource , it 's a pretty major announcement for us , because we essentially created , for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications , a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel and I think it makes , in fact , our Cloud more attractive to many of them because of that . I think going forward we will -- you 'll look to see or you 'll see us do much more of this with many other customers of ours . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy Hood , Microsoft Corp.", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

We 're encouraged by the improvements we 've seen year-over-year and we do expect material improvement in FY17 , both from the benefits of scale and the investments we 've made , but importantly also in the revenue trajectory we 're seeing and the makeup of that revenue . Boeing 's agreement is one such agreement , in terms of embedding a premium service at a premium gross margin . We signed many of those this quarter that we feel quite good about . I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS 's margin profile and still feel good about the progress we 're making .

Overall , Karl , the focus for us is in what I describe as this hyper scale plus hybrid approach . When you think about the cloud approach , which is pretty unique to us , and the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business and how is our Cloud growth . And if you look at this last quarter , our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits , and that 's a pretty healthy growth rate . And that 's something that , by design both in terms of the technical architecture , as well as the traction we", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

The transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro environment , IT budgets and also the secular shift to the cloud . The question again that gets asked is about the cannibalization . But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the Cloud , our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our Cloud . So at a fundamental long-term secular basis , we have new growth , new workloads and that 's what we 're focused on and that 's a much bigger addressable market than anything our transactional server business had in the past . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Chris Suh , Microsoft Corp. - General Manager IR [ 10 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thank you , Karl .

Let me split your question into two components . The first thing , really , that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter , every month is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and specifically to the cloud . We structure all of our motions at this Company from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets , to how we think about sales engagement , to how we do our investments , Fundamentally , toward that long-term structural transition in the market . And so to your question on transactional performance , there were some deals that did n't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4 . And there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I 'm thrilled by . But at the same time we still will focus on those deals moving to the Cloud", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 32, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

So that 's one massive advantage we have . The second area for us is also the nexus between what 's happening in Office 365 , Dynamics 365 , AppSource , and in fact this last quarter some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform . At our partner conference there was significant amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like PowerApps and Power BI , Azure functions and flow . These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure . And so to me , that 's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us . And then lastly , we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers . Not only is .NET first class , but Linux is first class , Java is first class , Azure Container Service cuts across both containers running on Windows , running across Linux , so again , speaks to the enterprise realities . So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated and that 's what you see us gaining , both for enterprise customers and ISVs .

So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in some -- most cases into an ISV solution , which ultimately will even participate in AppSource . So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy Hood , Microsoft Corp. - CFO [ 22 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I would also add , Heather , the importance of the motion in our field organization and go-to-market with ISVs is incredibly high in terms of selling with and along with those ISVs , both making them successful and thereby helping us build very important scale through the platform .

Let me start with the Office consumer question . We have n't had a chance to touch on that . And then we 'll talk about commercial seat growth . You 're right , the Office consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it , even though we have moved , and you saw that growth , the subscriber base sort of materially , the growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused . One , the PC market was a little better than we thought . And particularly in developed markets , the PC growth was better than we thought . And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with consumer Office that impacts in quarter . So the strength from that outperformance or better market and consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office consumer . And so that 's how to think about that big delta . The other thing was Japan was a little better and when Japan is better , it 's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency . We have a lot", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 47, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

So the Japan performance being better also helped . That is a purely -- it 's more transactional than even our Rest-of-World business . So you 're right , Raimo , in terms of what impacted that number in-quarter versus the underlying market dynamics . On commercial seats , listen , we 're very proud of that big number , growth number , but you 're right , we 're also getting a very big base . And so , while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate , converting and adding net new into our install base , you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Raimo Lenschow , Barclays Capital - Analyst [ 38 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thank you . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 48, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers , first I should say I think most people assume , and it is true to a certain extent , so much of this is the growth in our commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365 and that 's true . But we 're also seeing quite good growth in some of the consumer businesses , which also are built on our Cloud infrastructure . Search , some of our gaming assets , our Xbox Live business going forward , and so many of these assets , including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office do require capital spend . And so the growth is pretty broad-based to support . And so , as I think about moderation , it is the absolute dollar . It 's from -- it 's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue and I want to be clear on that . It really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Gregg Moskowitz , Cowen and Company - Analyst [ 43 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 51, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

In some sense Ross you 're trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world . The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume some very simplistically that that digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach . Because right now , given the secular trend to of move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe , we think it 's wiser for us and our investors long-term to be able to meet them where they are and that 's what you see us . We were the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law , the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law . And these are critical competitive advantages to us . And so we will track that and we 'll be very demand-driven . So there is , in this case , we 're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand .

This commitment to our customers ' success is resulting in deeper partnerships , larger multi-year cloud agreements and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration . Now I 'll briefly highlight our innovation and momentum . In a world where every company is a software company , developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization . And GitHub is their home . GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises , including a majority of the Fortune 50 . And we 're investing to build the complete toolchain for developers , independent of language , framework and cloud . Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world . With Azure DevOps , you can build , test and deploy code to any platform . And with Azure PlayFab , we have LiveOps , a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time .

Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge , spanning identity management , security and infrastructure . This year , we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect , bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated . Azure Sphere is a first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU-powered endpoints coming online each year . And now IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code . Azure is the most open cloud and this quarter , we expanded our partnerships with Oracle , Red Hat and VMware to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure . Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers ' entire data estate . The variety , velocity and the volume of data is increasing , and we are bringing hyperscale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database . New analytics support in Cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data . And we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI .

In FY '19 , we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements with material growth in the number of $ 10 million-plus Azure agreements . Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations , increasing 22 % and 25 % in constant currency , driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts .

Other income was $ 191 million , higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains .

In other income and expense , interest income and expenses should offset each other . Next , we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year expected tax rate of 17 % due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter .

I wanted to focus on the Office 365 . If I 'm looking at this right , I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 Commercial business . And the kind of recipe to get in there seemed to have changed a little bit in that it 's more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth . Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what 's pushing growth there ? Because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit . It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter .

Let me walk through a little bit of this because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter . But the fundamentals that you talked about are relatively unchanged . We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business . That 's happening not just because of frontline workers but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base . We did see ARPU growth this quarter . It was n't as much different from past quarters . We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transition , saw both again . And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter , which was great to see . What you saw a little bit , and I referred to it , was some more in-quarter recognition , but let me talk about why that 's happening because it 's got 2 important", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jul-18", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jul-18-MSFT.txt"}}

What you saw a little bit , and I referred to it , was some more in-quarter recognition , but let me talk about why that 's happening because it 's got 2 important and positive trends that underlie it . The first thing is we 're seeing longer commitments . When you say longer commitments under 606 , you often have more recognition upfront . And so we saw longer commitments and we got a little bit more recognition in the quarter , and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster . The other thing that we saw is increasing focus . As we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us , it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions . And so the fact that we -- then we 're often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts . When that happens , it 's almost like they 're adding new product and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen . And so when you have a dynamic where you 're seeing longer contracts plus you 're able to sell more and new things and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365 , it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero experience . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jul-18", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jul-18-MSFT.txt"}}

We 've always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC . But going forward , we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games , which is where our structural position is . And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming . We have a social", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jul-18", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jul-18-MSFT.txt"}}

So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming in spite of all the success we 've had over the years in gaming . Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment . So if you think about what we are doing with xCloud , it 's a hero workload on top of Azure . So when we think about capital allocation , what 's happening in the cloud , what 's happening in the edge , how we build the network to optimize the streaming , the same infrastructure , for example , is what Sony has decided to use as well and be on Azure as well as use our AI capabilities . So you 'll see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming , Microsoft 365 , Dynamics 365 , LinkedIn all being the same . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 7 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jul-18", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jul-18-MSFT.txt"}}

That footprint , and you could see it in our results , customers are relying on us for not only that footprint but as they continue to expand , they sit under of a Tier 1 opportunity we have n't seen before .

How much of a tail do you think we have left on the Win 7 to Win 10 migration ? Is it too cautious to say that there 's really just 2 quarters of that tailwind left ?

I do n't actually combine these because really , there 's a fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support . There is , I think , a recognized momentum with Windows 10 , its deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop . We 've worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest in security for all of our products , one of the places I think that often resonates the most is Windows 10 and inside that value . The OEM Pro number , as I talked about , was impacted by a number of factors . But what we 've seen is over the past 3 or 4 quarters , pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts from chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs . That performance certainly has some end-of-support impact to it as we talked about before .

And it 's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have . And so we 'll see some extensions pass the line , we certainly have seen 3 or 4 quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong . The more important part around the security and management value prop is in fact I 'm going to pivot back again a little bit because it 's the same thing we saw in Office . The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers , especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4 , has 3 components . It has Office 365 , it has EMS and it has this Windows 10 commercial component . The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success in our motions , in overall being able to sell the Microsoft 365 value prop . It was a good quarter for that . We 've seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that . I expect that to continue .

So overall , I think , first , there 's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we 're seeing . And I think in fact , unlike any other time other than Windows , we 've not had this kind of platform effect . Office has obviously had very , very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly . But each of them was a singular tool . Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind . But Teams is -- transcends all that . It 's the communications tool , it 's the collaboration tool . It 's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process . And so the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment , whether it 's on the first-line . The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers , which has been really the only place traditionally we play . Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers whereas now we actually have specific value which is in fact very valuable to those first-line workers . And the thing that we realized is the businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first-line worker productivity .

The one other benefit , to sort of tease off of some of the comments Amy was making , is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale .

All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year , unless otherwise noted . We also provide growth rates in constant currency , when available , as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed , excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations . At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin . However , due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings we are n't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth . And consequently can not derive constant currency segment operating income either . We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the Company-wide level . Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow . Additionally , any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our form 10Q and includes research and development , sales and marketing , and general and administrative , but excludes the impact of last year 's integration and restructuring charges .

Today Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead . Overall this quarter we had solid performance , and more importantly drove growth in areas that are key to our future . We delivered $ 25.7 billion in revenue with an operating income of $ 7.9 billion . We continue to advance towards our goals for FY18 . Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $ 9.4 billion , up over 70 % year over year , and almost halfway to our goal of $ 20 billion . We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months . We also made progress towards our goal of more than $ 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices . We crossed the 200 million milestone , and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems . In fact , adoption is nearly 140 % faster than Windows 7 . I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results . Now let 's get to the specifics for each of the three segments , starting with Productivity and Business Process . As we seek to help people get more out of every moment , we 're delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365 . Consumer response to Office is strong . Office attach rate is up . Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time . And consumer subscriptions are up", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jan-28", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-28-MSFT.txt"}}

Office attach rate is up . Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time . And consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million . We are also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms . On iOS and Android , Skype is more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpass 340 million this quarter . There also 13 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook . Office 365 Commercial revenue grew nearly 70 % in constant currency , while seats grew 59 % . It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we 're delivering in Office 365 and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection . In December we released a major update to Skype for Business which drives productivity up and costs down . Our customers can now use Skype for Business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees . Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all of our segments . As customers look to protect themselves , we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions . The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25 % quarter over quarter . At the same time , we released new capabilities like advanced [ ware ] protection , advanced E-discovery and customer lock box . These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration skew , E5 , which we released last month", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jan-28", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-28-MSFT.txt"}}

These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration skew , E5 , which we released last month . Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud . This quarter we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM , both of which deliver enhancements in mobility , insights , and organizational productivity as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365 . Three out of four of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud , which is driving continued triple digit paid seat growth for CRM online in the enterprise . Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers . This quarter we exposed the data APIs which capture the relationships between people , conversations , projects , schedules , processes and content . We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph . The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for customers and partners . Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs . Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications , like Oracle Sales Cloud , and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications . Now let 's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment . The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive , larger than any market we have ever participated in . Last quarter I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in this space .

Last quarter I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in this space . At the same time , we are the only one in this market providing SaaS , PasS , IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale . We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously . Our unique approach is resonating . Our cloud architecture reflects real-world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation . Azure revenue grew 140 % this quarter in constant currency , with revenue coming from new and existing customers . We saw organizations like NTT DOCOMO , Honeywell , NASA 's jet propulsion labs , Dow Chemical and the UN Development Program deploy innovative solutions on Azure . We see that Azure customers who also purchase Office 365 consume 8 times more Azure than other customers . More than 70 % of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings , up 13 points year over year . And now we are continuing to grow in new ways . Together with Red Hat , Dell and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise , we will increase our ability to address real-world infrastructure needs . These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications based applications with our cloud . We are leading innovation in new agile and DevOps workloads as well , with Azure app services , power apps and Visual Studio team services where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions . We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jan-28", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-28-MSFT.txt"}}

We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas , finance , e-commerce , consulting , and healthcare . As we expand into new markets our revenue from premium services like security , mobility , management , and analytics nearly tripled year over year . Enterprise mobility solution customers have more than doubled year over year , and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months . Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption . As threats become more frequent and sophisticated , Azure 's unique technologies like Machine Learning , empower customers to adapt to these new realities . This quarter we organized the Enterprise Cyber Security Group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks . We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the UK that address customers ' data access and sovereignty needs . And we continue to release new capabilities like advanced threat analytics as part of our $ 1 billion product innovation and security spanning Azure , Office 365 , Windows 10 and our enterprise mobility suite . At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence , powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future . Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence . We released Cortana Analytics last July . It 's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people , places ,", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Jan-28", "chunk_index": 8, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Jan-28-MSFT.txt"}}

It 's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people , places , and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation . Coca-Cola , Russell Reynolds , and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers , uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized healthcare . Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform . In the More Personal Computing segment I 'm encouraged by our progress to unify our install base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem . As of this month we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10 . Near term , in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year , we 're focused on three ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft . First , deliver more value and innovation , particularly for enterprise customers who need advanced productivity , security , and device management . Second , grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform . Third , continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs . Let me briefly expand on each . First , in November we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios : security , manageability and ease of deployment .

First , in November we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios : security , manageability and ease of deployment . More than 76 % of our enterprise customers are in active pilots , including organizations like Kimberly-Clark and Alaska Airlines , and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10 . We are well-positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half . Next , as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows store , search , and gaming . This holiday season we doubled Windows store paid transactions from PC and tablets customers . This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up and the addition of new Windows 10 applications . This quarter Netflix , Pandora , Uber , Wall Street Journal , NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences . For example , you can ask Cortana to recognize a song on Shazam , play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber . With search , the clearest indicator of our progress is US search share , where Bing now exceeds 21 % . Nearly 30 % of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices , partly as a result of user engagement with Cortana . We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions . This holiday we saw record engagement on Xbox Live . Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs .

Our games also performed strongly this quarter . We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft-published titles year over year . Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10 , iOS and Android . And we grew monthly active users by 18 % year over year . Lastly , we are innovating in new device categories and driving growth . With Surface we created a new type of device , the two-in-one , and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success . At the same time this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $ 1.3 billion in sales , driven by the launch of surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand-new Surface Book . We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China , Japan , the UK , France , Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia . We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem . Near term we are taking the right steps .

Before turning over to Amy , I want to briefly reflect on the past few months . I 've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today . Of course any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business . But increasingly , I think it also creates opportunity for us . Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies , insights , and ultimately transform . This is at the heart of our mission . I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas while finding new growth for ourselves . With that , I 'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter 's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter .

This quarter revenue was $ 25.7 billion , down 2 % , and up 3 % in constant currency . Gross margin declined slightly , but was up 5 % in constant currency . We grew operating income this quarter by 3 % , and 13 % in constant currency . And earnings per share was $ 0.78 , growing 11 % , or 23 % in constant currency . We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments in innovation and consistent execution . From a geographic perspective , our performance in most markets was as expected . The key markets like Brazil , China , Japan , and Russia continue to be challenging . Our commercial business once again delivered solid results , as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals . Commercial bookings increased 12 % , up 19 % in constant currency . And commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $ 19.6 billion , or 8 % growth in constant currency . In addition , our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high of $ 25.5 billion . With our continued cloud growth , our commercial annuity mix reached 83 % , up 5 points year over year .

In Q2 total commercial cloud gross margin was 46 % , an increase of 9 points year over year , driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure . Last quarter I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments . In Q2 the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated , though the US dollar trended stronger than expected in December . This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations , rounding up to 5 points . Consistent with Q1 , and as Chris explained , we are not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income . In general , FX had a favorable impact of 3 % on operating expenses at the total Company level . Now let 's turn to each segment 's results .

And we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand . This quarter we invested $ 2 billion , up sequentially from the $ 1.5 billion invested last quarter .

I want to preface my remarks with three overall comments , and then move to more specific comments by segment . First , FX . I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2 . For Q3 , given the recent strengthening of the US dollar , we now expect an overall impact of 4 points .

We expect our commercial business to remain healthy , with ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services . Therefore , even with continuing currency headwinds , we expect commercial on our revenue to be within the range of $ 18.8 billion to $ 19 billion . Our commercial cloud run rate trajectory remains on path , with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services . Office 365 , Azure , and Dynamics online ( inaudible ) the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue . Third , we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and we 'll increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year . Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment . In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $ 6.4 billion to $ 6.6 billion , which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact . This represents 6 % year-over-year growth in constant currency , driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics online .

For phone , we expect similar year-over-year revenue climb , and in the gross margin percentage for Q3 should look similar to Q2 . After a solid launch quarter with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 , we anticipate continued momentum and growth with Surface Book expanding into additional countries .

The way we think about cloud is how I described it in my remarks , which is it 's the combination of the work we are actually doing in the SaaS , PasS , IaaS , and also a hybrid cloud layer . Because we do n't think , for example , of our servers as a distinct part . But it 's in fact the edge of our cloud and we are building for that with things like Azure stack . We think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future , we speak to more of the real-world needs , I think , of an IT organization or a business organization that is transform through digital technology . If you put yourself as a CIO of a multinational organization and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty and then you want to be able to take some workloads , move them all to the cloud . Some you want to be able to tier with the cloud , that 's the kind of flexibility we provide .

In some sense if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as Intelligent Cloud , we are operating in a much bigger market . And that 's because , first of all , the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories , as well as take something that you mentioned , which is Linux .

Satya , following up on the cloud discussion , recognizing that SaaS , PasS , infrastructure as a server hybrid , they 're all related , but as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business , how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PasS versus infrastructure as a service ? PasS is much smaller industry-wide today , but is the opportunity is big , bigger ? How should we think about that ?

So I think that depending what -- if you are bringing something over , your IaaS will be heavy first and then PasS will grow . If you are starting new you will have Pass , which is going to be the first thing you do . But then you 'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing , existing data , existing code in a virtual machine .

In terms of the margin profile , the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5 , that is the thing that Amy talked about , which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products . In Office 365 that is most evident with E3 and now E5 . Even in Azure we have things like EMS , we have our data services , even our developer services .

Good afternoon , everyone . We delivered record results this fiscal year powered by our commercial cloud , which surpassed $ 50 billion in revenue for the first time , up 36 % year-over-year . The last 5 months have made it very clear that digital tech intensity is key to business resilience . Organizations that build their own digital capability will recover faster and emerge from this crisis stronger .

We are seeing businesses accelerate the digitization of every part of their operations from manufacturing to sales and customer service , to reimagine how they meet customer needs from curbside pickup and contactless shopping in retail to telemedicine in healthcare . That 's why we are building the full modern technology stack powered by cloud and AI , and underpinned by security and compliance , to help every organization digitally transform . Now I 'll highlight our innovation and momentum , starting with Azure . Every organization today needs a distributed computing fabric to run essential workloads . We are building Azure as the world 's computer to support them with data center regions -- more data center regions than any other provider , including new regions as of this quarter in Italy , New Zealand and Poland . We have always led in hybrid , and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers ' needs wherever they are . Azure Arc is the first control plane built for a multi-cloud , multi-edge world , and we are taking it further with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes . New capabilities in Azure Stack HCI help organizations bring the cloud to their very own data centers . And our acquisitions of Affirmed and Metaswitch , along with Azure Edge Zones , extend Azure to the network edge , expanding our offering to telecom operators as they move to 5G . Our differentiated approach across cloud and edge is winning new customers in every industry from Land O'Lakes , the National Australia Bank to Johns Hopkins Medicine , as well as leading ISVs including Citrix , Fenestra , SAS and Workday .

The combination of SQL Hyperscale , Cosmos DB , Synapse Analytics and the new Synapse Link , which enables live analytics on real-time transactions , differentiate Azure . In AI , we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools , frameworks and infrastructure . We 're thrilled with the progress our partner , OpenAI , is making .

And in our consumer business , increased demand from work- , learn- and play-from-home scenarios again benefited our Gaming , Surface and Windows OEM non-Pro businesses . We also saw weakness in small and medium business purchasing , which primarily impacted our transactional Office and Windows OEM Pro businesses , and drove some moderation to our Office 365 Commercial paid seat growth . And in our search business , though rates stabilized through the quarter , we saw a continued reduction in advertising spend on our platform . Moving to our overall results , customer commitment to our cloud continues to grow . In FY '20 , we closed a record number of multimillion-dollar commercial cloud agreements with material growth in the number of $ 10 million-plus Azure contracts . And on a strong prior-year comparable , commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations , increasing 12 % year-over-year , driven by consistent renewal execution and an increase in the number of large , long-term Azure contracts .

In other income and expense , interest income , net gains on derivatives , investments and foreign currency remeasurement were mostly offset by interest expense . Our effective tax rate was slightly below 17 % , lower than expected due to the geographic mix of revenue .

This has been included in the guidance we 'll provide on today 's call , and you will find additional details on the mechanics of the change in our earnings materials . Now let 's move to our next-quarter outlook . In our Commercial business , given our differentiated position in growth markets , we expect continued commitment to our cloud platform as well as strong usage and consumption growth . In our Consumer business , we expect some continued benefit from work- , learn- and play-from-home scenarios in Gaming and Surface , though at a more moderated rate , as stay-at-home guidelines ease in many places around the world . However , we expect the small- and medium-business weakness we saw in Q4 to continue , which will impact transactional sales , primarily in Office and Windows OEM . In commercial bookings , growth should again be healthy , but we will be impacted by the strong prior-year comparable and a low growth in the Q1 expiry base .

And on a dollar basis , we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter to support the growing usage and demand for our cloud services . Next , to FX . Based on current rates , FX should decrease total company , Productivity and Business Process and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on More Personal Computing revenue , total company COGS and operating expense growth . Now to the segment guidance . In Productivity and Business Processes , we expect revenue between $ 11.65 billion and $ 11.9 billion . In Office Commercial , on a strong prior year comparable , revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with continued upsell opportunity to E5 . However , growth will be impacted by a decline of approximately 30 % in our on-premises business driven by the transactional weakness in small and medium businesses noted earlier . In Office Consumer , we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year as subscription growth will be offset by a decline in our transactional business .

The thing that at least we have learned , I would say , in the last 5 months is that digital technology is no longer viewed as just new project starts , but it 's becoming perhaps the most key for business resilience . Business continuity obviously is a board-level discussion everywhere . But I do n't think digital tech as sort of being key to business resilience was the # 1 priority whereas now it is . So I think that that 's , I think , what -- when I think about digital transformation now , I break it into 2 things .

So I wanted to make sure to decouple those a teeny bit . And I think in general for us , this quarter , the consumption patterns were very , very similar actually to what we expected , to Satya 's note , with the pressure to , I think , move to this new frontier being really at the forefront of people 's minds , far more so than maybe a discussion on per-user impacts . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 22 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Brent John Thill , Jefferies LLC , Research Division - Equity Analyst [ 23 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Jul-22", "chunk_index": 42, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jul-22-MSFT.txt"}}

Right now what I would like us to focus on in the interest of our long-term investors is to say , how can we build this modern tech stack so that it can really capture -- both help customers transform , be resilient and help us get into new categories and build a strong position in those categories . So my own approach to this would be not to worry as much about short term , whether it 's the growth number because when you are growing compared to where GDP is , healthily and competitively , the growth number is high . I 'm not trying to match some artificial double-digit growth number , and nor are we trying to sort of think about a margin target because , in some sense , the world needs to do well for us to do well in the long run . And I think the world will come out of this , and we will be stronger if we invest during this phase . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

The opportunity that Satya really outlined in his remarks is , I do believe , fundamental . And so you see us continuing to invest . You 'll see it in capital expenditure based on demand . You 'll see it in the operating expense line . And a lot of the margin movement you 're going to see is going to be actually far more sales mix than it is to think about it as margins going down in a particular product . So for me , it 's really about in every product are we investing with a strong position , with a clearer view of the future in a way that we can be a more important part of every customer 's budget . And so I think we feel very good about the products we 've got , the lineup we 've got and the execution engine we 've got .

As you saw , we made great progress this quarter , catching up from supply chain challenges that I think we entered the quarter with . And as you can imagine , with the Teams surge and usage along with other workload surges , we look forward to continuing to be able to invest to meet that demand ahead of the curve , in addition to what Satya mentioned , which is continuing to enter new regions where we see opportunities . So for me , the way to think about it is you see the cloud revenue growth continuing , you see strong consumption and usage growth and you should expect cloud CapEx to follow in pretty short order . The lead times there have gotten tighter over time , and so you can generally think they 'll be more correlated .

This Gaming TAM is much more expansive than what we participated in , even with all of the success we had with Xbox . So we think going forward Xbox , with the approach we are taking , has much more of an ability to reach the 2-plus billion gamers out there , and we are in the early days of building that out .

Our trusted extensible cloud platform spanning application infrastructure , data and AI , productivity and collaboration as well as business applications enables every organization to create their own intelligent systems and experiences to compete and grow . Now I 'll briefly highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our business . Microsoft 365 empowers everyone from the largest multinationals to small businesses , from knowledge workers to first-line workers with an integrated , secure , compliant experience on any device . It 's the only comprehensive productivity , collaboration and communication solutions that integrates with an organization 's business process workflows . Microsoft Teams brings together everything a team needs : messaging , video conferencing , meetings and collaboration into a single integrated user experience scaffolding , eliminating the need for discrete apps that only increase an organization 's security and compliance exposure . 91 of the Fortune 100 use Teams , and more than 150 organizations have over 10,000 active users . And we are expanding Teams to new industries like health care with priority notifications for patient care and the ability to securely access patient records . Cybersecurity is a central challenge , and Microsoft is the clear leader in cloud security with our unparalleled operational security posture and our growing portfolio of security and compliance solutions spanning identity , device endpoints , e-mail , information , cloud applications as well as infrastructure .

Bookings growth was driven by healthy renewals on an expiration base that was over 20 % larger than a year ago as well as an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts . As a reminder , an increased mix of these larger long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings will drive more volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth . Commercial cloud revenue was $ 9.6 billion , growing 41 % and 43 % in constant currency , highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S. , Western Europe , the U.K. and Germany . Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 63 % driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin .

In our on-premise server business , demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings should remain strong . And we expect continued benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows Server and SQL Server 2008 though , as a reminder , their prior year comparable will impact the year-over-year growth rate .

The first is the expiration base absolutely does matter , and that 's why we talked about it . And we had a , actually , very good quarter here in terms of renewals and what I think of as revenue recapture where we 're able to grow the revenue in existing contracts . And so that absolutely contributed and has contributed over the past couple of years to what I do believe has been", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 22, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}
{"id": "MSFT_2019-Apr-24_300_23", "text": ", very good quarter here in terms of renewals and what I think of as revenue recapture where we 're able to grow the revenue in existing contracts . And so that absolutely contributed and has contributed over the past couple of years to what I do believe has been reasonably consistent commercial bookings strength versus the expiration base . The second component is what I would put in bucket of new business whether that new business comes as what you saw this quarter , 2 ways : there was some on-prem strength this quarter . It does show up in bookings . It does n't show up in unearned , and it does show up in the P & L . We had a good quarter there . And we did have some large Azure contracts , which tend to be longer-dated and tend to have low billings upfront . That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way . And so you will see as we go forward , and you 're already starting to see it , more volatility in this number not just based on the way we 've traditionally talked about it , which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger , longer-term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers , but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where , to your point , we 're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future . And so you will see a little bit of volatility in this number as those contracts and those types of contracts start to land . On your second question of Azure GM ,", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

And so you will see a little bit of volatility in this number as those contracts and those types of contracts start to land . On your second question of Azure GM , we have continued to see strong improvement in the core gross margin of Azure . The team has done a nice job on a number of fronts , continue to make progress on both software innovation but also importantly hardware innovation and working with our supply chain to continue to have and see benefits on that side . Also is increasing use of premium services also contributed to Azure gross margin improvement . So while we remain focused on efficiency and the utilization of the hardware and software , it 's also important to continue to see premium upsell , premium workload usage , so that customers are getting the most out of their deployments and usage of the Azure platform . In general , I -- it has n't changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus , I think , variable base . It 's still been in that , I think , low 40 % as a range for us in terms of what 's depreciation versus what 's more variable . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 4 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

I 'm going to pick a similar question to Heather 's but directed at you , Satya , to try to get a higher-level answer . In terms of -- during this quarter , it just sounds to me like I 've heard Amy talk more about exceeding expectations than we have in prior quarters and exceeding plan more than we have in prior quarters . This matches up from what we 're hearing in our CIO survey as we 've been talking to customers .

Today , in 2019 , hybrid 's become much more mainstream , but we were talking about this even 5 years ago . They also sort of said things that will matter in this transition to the cloud will be consistency and productivity . So for example , whether it 's developer productivity or IT productivity , it 's not any one dimension , you need to bring IT and developers together to drive agility in an organization and the digital capability building . This is again a place where we 've had also traditional strength and that 's showing up in the marketplace . And also , if you look at our cloud stack , we have application and infrastructure , data and AI , productivity and collaboration as well as business applications , that 's pretty unique again . So that 's , I think , what is showing up at scale as competitive differentiation , and that 's what you see in our numbers . But most importantly , I think you see it in the customer momentum and what I believe is what is customer success . Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation .

The first is obviously the OEM and chip supply . The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and falls to the bottom . Japan as a geography for us is a high transactional market . And so when Japan is strong , it tends to be a very high margin landing down to the bottom line . And the other one is the on-premises server number , which is very good , in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also is high margin . So when that happens , you do see , because it 's a lot of -- almost 100 % in-quarter recognition , a lot of help at the operating margin line .

I would say , Mark , the main thing that this offering enables is the flexibility with which customers can adopt hybrid computing . And as I 've always said that there is -- hybrid computing is important for workloads that are more in the characteristic or can be characterized as lift , shift and modernize . So that 's one motion . And then there is new world hybrid as well , which is people are building . In fact , they 'll do an AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge . And in both of these cases , hybrid benefits actually help with -- our business model is basically differentiated in supporting the architectural needs and the flexibility needs . The one additional thing I 'll mention , which is increasingly becoming clear to us , is operational sovereignty will become important . The world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some homogeneous set of requirements , but it 's going to be very heterogeneous , very , in many cases , regulated . And so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model , I think , shows up with the maximum flexibility . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 31, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

This is a benefit that 's fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make the determination of when to make that choice . And so it tends to be why I keep focusing people back on the all-up KPI because it 's the best representation of really customer commitment and usage of our architected-from-the-beginning hybrid cloud .

I wanted to turn to the Office 365 Commercial business a bit , and that 's been a consistent , very strong performer for you all and was again this quarter . But maybe just sort of 2 related questions there . First , if I heard you right , Satya , I think you said there was 180 million users now on Office 365 Commercial , which seems like you 're hitting a lot of the customers that you thought might be there a couple of years ago . So I was just curious to get your view on how far along you are in that adoption cycle and if there 's still a lot more opportunity in terms of seat expansion in the upcoming year . And then related , Amy , you mentioned E3 and E5 were both pretty big contributors on the ASP front in the quarter . Are we starting to see a shifting where E5 is sort of increasing in relevance and E3 is played out a bit ? Or is this sort of equally balanced ? I 'm just curious to get sort of the mixing there as well . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

In terms of overall reach of Office 365 , we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions . So for example , we never participated as much in , I would call it , nondeveloped market medium and small businesses with all of the sophisticated workloads . So now that -- with the SaaS approach , you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world , is one opportunity . The second opportunity is if you look at Teams as an example , we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers . So this is whether it 's in health care , whether it 's in manufacturing , whether it 's in retail , just not knowledge workers but where you now have messaging solutions as well as business process workflows integrated . So it 's that combination of things where you 're going from knowledge workers to first-line , going -- and the ability to reach all sizes", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 37, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

And then of course , there is the other dimension , which is the levels of Office 365 all the way to E5 with significant value . And the one thing I would mention is having compliance security that spans all of these tools is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage and a customer value proposition because I think as customers look to use more SaaS applications , they do n't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden . And so therefore , Office 365 's approach resonates even there . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

What I mean by that is that 27 % seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned , whether that 's in academic , in edu , in frontline workers . And that 's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it 's not at the same ARPU level , those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level , and that 's absolutely a new opportunity for us . But it does tend to mask a little some of the ARPU improvement that we 've seen . It 's still E3 and E5 .

And we are doing well , much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these Tier 1 workloads , which we never saw in the past .

And really , the question is we have quite a bit of per-seat or per-user type businesses . But what Satya just talked about is really about the Azure concept of participating both in an expansionary total addressable market , which I think people have talked about for a long time . But what was different about what Satya just said is our ability frankly to have higher share in the next era than we had in the last era", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 42, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

But I do n't want that to really diminish the fact that there 's a lot of room for us in our per-seat businesses , particularly in business applications across LinkedIn , the Power Platform work we 're doing . Satya mentioned security , identity , compliance .

We continue to see this really nice progression in the commercial cloud gross margin , and you called out the Azure gross margin improvements . And within that , there 's some moving pieces . I think you 've got better utilization and efficiency of core Azure . You 've got premium services , and then you 've got this maybe counter-prevailing force of the different growth in consumption versus user base . Two questions on this , one for Satya . On the premium services , I 'm just curious as to which 1 or 2 or 3 are you seeing maybe break out and become the largest or grow the fastest , which are most meaningful at this point ?

I mean on the first question , Ross , as far as premium services , just even on the application infrastructure side , for example , in compute , there is increasing need for things like IoT services . Essentially , there is a new business application-like set of services that are getting developed to help people manage their complex IoT application development . IoT Central is a good example of that . When you have many , many connected devices , you need a control plane for many of those devices so that you can tame the complexity of your app deployments , security management . That 's one example . The other one is , of course , data . And the sophistication of the data estate is growing exponentially both in terms of the needs of the databases required , the processing that is required close to data . So that 's another place where something like Cosmos DB , which is very unique in its capability in the marketplace , is definitely another service that", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 45, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

I want to follow up on Karl 's question but more generally on database products . With the end of support coming for SQL Server 2008 in July , Satya , can you tell us how that 's sparking conversations with customers about database offerings on Azure and moving workloads to the cloud ? And Amy , can you perhaps help us contextualize the opportunity to move traditional database workloads onto Azure and what the expansion economics look like ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Satya Nadella , Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [ 29 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes . A couple of things , Brad . One is overall , the need to get on the latest and greatest database technology just because of what is the increasing need for compute and data at the edge is what 's driving a lot of the conversations on SQL Server . Interestingly enough , we have a lot of requirements around edge devices", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 48, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

Interestingly enough , we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even so that you can have databases with compute , so that you can really have what is needed at the edge . That 's sort of one conversation . The other one is in terms of the cloud migration , there is a variety of different use cases . We see people who are using SQL DB , which is essentially a PaaS service with the complete compatibility of SQL Server . They want managed services around SQL Server , which we have . And so both of those are all happening in parallel . A good example of this is , in fact , even the rewrite of -- complete revamp , I would say , of Dynamics . Dynamics 365 and its architecture , at least in my eyes , is a thing of beauty because it 's completely been rewritten for the new database technology , whether it is in the database side or on the data warehouse side , again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data . That type of architectural approach is what we see is possible now for every SaaS application when they 're out there as well because we think about the number of SaaS -- number of business applications that were built on SQL Server , I feel that , that 's an architecture that can support both what they want to do on the edge but as well", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Apr-24", "chunk_index": 49, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Apr-24-MSFT.txt"}}

The strength of our results reflects accelerating innovation and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation . I shared our vision for the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge a little over a year ago , a vision that is now quickly becoming reality and impacting every customer in every industry .

We focus on the right secular technology trends and growing markets and follow that up with solid road map execution . We 've reorganized our engineering teams to break free of the categories of the past and better align with the emerging tech stack , from silicon to AI to experiences , to better serve the needs of our customers today and long into the future . We reoriented our sales and marketing teams , adding industry and technical expertise to partner more deeply with our customers on their digital transformation journeys . And most importantly , we drove innovation to deliver differentiated value across the cloud and the edge . Now I 'll briefly highlight some of our innovation and momentum .

Overall , the key drivers and trends of our business for the next fiscal year remain largely unchanged from April and assume a consistent macro environment . First on FX . Assuming that rates remain stable , we expect no impact to full year revenue growth , with any FX benefits in H1 offset in H2 . FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point . Second , our commercial business . Given corporate IT spend optimism and increasing demand for cloud services , our strong competitive product position and consistent sales execution , we expect another year of strong revenue growth and higher annuity mix across commercial business . As customer commitment to our cloud increases , we are seeing larger and longer-term agreements . As a result , we may see increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial unearned revenue .

Third , commercial cloud gross margin percentage . We expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage . The rate of improvement will moderate relative to FY '18 as revenue mix continues to shift to Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and we realize less year-over-year improvement in our per user services . We will continue to increase our investments in CapEx to meet growing demand for our cloud services , although , we do expect the growth rate for the year to moderate . Next , operating expenses . Given our strong execution , we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe are fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation . Investment in commercial cloud , LinkedIn , gaming and AI should result in operating expense growth of roughly 7 % .

I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit . I think growth overall in Azure this quarter is probably ahead of most people 's expectations . And it sounds like the type of business that 's being done on Azure is becoming more strategic and changing a little bit . So Satya , I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the types of workloads , the type of sort of services that are being used on Azure , how that 's evolved over the past year . And Amy , for you , maybe there 's a new KPI , I believe , you gave us sort of the growth in the Enterprise Mobility up 55 % . Was that in line with your expectations because I know you were sort of tempering our expectations on growth in that part of the business ? Is that growing in line with kind of the slowdown you were expecting ? Or is that better than you had imagined ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 21, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

Overall , in terms of the workload mix , it 's been fairly stable , which is our hybrid value proposition really is -- continued to resonate , so that means there is a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud . People use both Azure Stack plus Azure , so that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us as people are sort of looking basically to lift and shift a lot of their current data center workloads . Then , on top of it , we even have a modernization of apps that is accelerating , and that drives a lot of the higher-level services , in particular , our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute , but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data , and that 's another place where we see increasing acceleration .

So really , Q4 was n't just renewal activity , it was also new workloads and new value . So when you look into '19 , I am optimistic on both of those fronts , good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value and new opportunity . And the third component of your question was really how did the renewal base correlate to FY '18 . The answer is it 's a little bigger but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter . So Q1 's renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 8 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

So on the first one , I actually think that these hybrid use benefits have been sort of the best kept secrets . So I 'm actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year , we do a much better job and customers do a much better job for their own benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid use benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal . And we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week , just really making sure everybody understands those benefits . So I do n't think that that has really played out . If we have seen anything , all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly really driving growth . But to your", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

If we have seen anything , all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly really driving growth . But to your second question , I 'll even say the following , which is that I think there is clearly a difference in GM between the per user and consumption . But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms . There is the IaaS services , there is the data services and some of the higher-level services . Some of these IoT services now even have SaaS components to it . So therefore , I think that the mix will be different by quarter by quarter . But increasingly , our strategy is , in many times , to get customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute but then they scale into these higher-level of services . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

But it really was more in Windows . And the value , as we continue to see in SQL next year , I do think there 's some opportunity for customers to realize real value from these hybrid benefits . And so it sort of adds confidence to my high teens KPI growth for the year is that this is a very customer value-oriented offer . To your question on GM , Satya 's obviously correct on that one . And I would say , the way we think about it is actually more -- when you talk about Azure per user , it really does move more with M365 per user . It 's almost better to put that in your mind as behaving more and having margin structures more like Office 365 and behave quite similarly . It tends to have good quarters when we do good execution on Office 365 . And so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion and that it tends to move in that direction . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 12 ] -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 30, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

On the first one , in terms of the GM this quarter , you 're right . The improvements , particularly in the IaaS and PaaS gross margin of Azure did offset the cloud mix to Azure within the segment . Going forward , continuing to see that . I think we 'll see more pressure on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate it 's growing , we 're still not at that point where $ 1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 32, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

That being said , we have a lot , as you saw this quarter , room to grow gross margin dollars in that within -- even within that frame going into FY '19 . On your second question in terms of capital spend , if you think about it at a high level , our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing . And that 's why you 're starting to see leverage , right , flow through the P & L . And I think that the rate of CapEx growth , as I said , in FY '19 will moderate . That happens because , of course , we 're doing some replacement but we 're also adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand . And so , we 're actually -- and improving margins . So I think that 's -- when I put it at a very high level as you asked the question , I tend to think revenue 's growing faster than my capital , you 're seeing leverage through the P & L , and we 'll see a moderating rate in FY '19 even if Q1 is a big quarter .

You 're right . The first one was the benefits that we saw from hybrid , in particular , with an outsized impact on Windows Server . The second has been a trend we also have talked about a little bit before . We saw strong double-digit growth in premium . So it was both mix shift as well as , I think , strength in the hybrid benefits as a value prop to customers .

And as you need to reason over large amounts of data , you need not only storage and compute to be colocated all over as the world gets embedded with computing . That 's what we are building for . So if you think about our real competitive advantage and differentiation is , we have one programming model , one identity model , security , management so that modern developers as well as IT can use the compute available from Azure Sphere to Azure . And the reality is these modern workloads , in fact , use it all . So it 's not like I just build an Azure Sphere application .

I know folks think about it that way , but it 's not . I mean , it 's about one small category in one segment called enterprise . There is a share . High share is considered 20 % , 35 % or what have you . So in some sense , this one has always been about being able to serve customers , especially in an increasing digitization world , right , which is the need for more business process automation is increasing . Take an IoT project , it translates into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as field service in Dynamics . That 's been one pattern we 've seen a ton of traction with . So to me , us going , in fact , to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margin and very high-priced monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 32 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jul-19", "chunk_index": 46, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jul-19-MSFT.txt"}}

But this quarter , that seat growth actually accelerated about 1 point to 29 % . And when we look back on it , the trajectory really is n't too different than where it was even a year ago .

We 're off to a strong start in fiscal 2020 , delivering $ 33 billion in revenue this quarter . Our commercial cloud business continues to grow at scale as we work alongside the world 's leading companies to help them build their own digital capability . Microsoft provides a differentiated technology stack spanning application infrastructure , data and AI , developer tools and services , security and compliance , business process , productivity and collaboration . For each of these areas -- first , each of these areas represents secular long-term growth opportunity . Second , we are delivering best-in-class innovation and openness in each layer . And third , we offer unparalleled integration and architectural coherence across the entire stack to meet the real-world needs of our customers .

Other income and expense should be approximately $ 50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense .

And any sense you can give us in terms of in what way do they engage both kind of the on-premise assets as well as the cloud assets ? Because I think that 's part of the equation that 's really positively surprising a lot of investors in how well server and tools is doing . And maybe for Amy , you could help us understand , sort of when we look at server and tools up 14 % in constant currency , which is well ahead of our expectations , how should we think about the durability of that in terms of what comes from sort of the pull forward of demand ahead of some -- like SQL Server and Windows Server expirations and what is going", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 21, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

Thanks for the question . Overall , our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric or thinking about hybrid as not as some transitory phase but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet the real-world needs because if you think about the long term , compute will migrate to wherever data is getting generated . And increasingly , there 'll be data generated in the real world where just -- when you think about the cloud , you have to think about the edge of the cloud as a very first-class construct .

And the rights to that , of course , are inherent in how we report this number . And so for us , what you 'll see is premium strength , which we saw this quarter in both SQL and Windows because of some of the value proposition of hybrid and of course , broad strength as well when people feel that flexibility to not be constrained by licensing in terms of how they view their estate . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 5 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs . -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

I 'm just wondering if you could share with us how much of the improvement is related to the need to maybe expand data centers at a lower clip than you have been . Maybe it 's less depreciation and amortization that 's coming -- that you 're starting to recognize . How much of it is due to just better capacity utilization then ?

Let me start by saying , in general , at the commercial cloud gross margin , what you 're seeing is revenue growth that , for the past almost 2 years , has vastly been faster than our capital expenditure growth . So if you start at the top of the frame , what we 're seeing is overall gross margin improvement across portfolio and improving -- and that comes from a couple of things , which is where you 're getting to on Azure . It comes from structural improvement on sort of cost per unit , but it also comes from mix shift of revenue to premium services , from being able to sell more SaaS-like services and consumption services or even premium data services that really do have both more margin but also are quite consistent in terms of their growth . And you see then", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

And you see then that represented as improving targets for us . But I would say in general , Heather , what the team has done is actually delivered on what I think we felt was a 5-year road map of improving gross margins on a material basis . Now as you continue to see the mix shift to the consumption-based Azure services , the overall cloud gross margin will improve at the same rate . And we 've said that , and you 'll continue to see that on a go-forward basis as well . But we do continue to expect Azure , especially on the consumption side gross margins , to improve . And they still have room to improve , especially as we start to see some of these premium services both being made available and being utilized at higher rates . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 8 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment , it seems to equate to an overall revenue growth rate assuming the midpoint of about 9 % to 10 % . So when I combine that with the 14 % growth you just put up in Q1 , it implies that , in the second half , overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10 % zip code to enable you to get to double-digit growth for the full year despite the fact that you 're moving past some fairly key end-of-support milestones . I think some of us were expecting a little bit more of a first half , second half delta . So I just wanted to ask you what are the maybe 1 or 2 or 3 drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half and if it 's fair to assume that", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

And we 've tried to be consistent in that while end of support will make for points here and there each quarter , the more sustainable trends are the fact that our commercial cloud overall offers significant value and differentiation to customers and are making longer-term commitments and we continue to grow ARPU . So when I think about sort of some of the seasonality that you 're talking about , Q2 , I felt we were -- I wanted to be clear that that 's really a gaming challenge in Q2 , and you see that reflected in the margins in Q2 being significantly better than they were last Q2 . And if you think about H2 , I do expect Surface will have some easier comparables in H2 and a new portfolio to grow from . So I think that 's another change you 'll see in trajectory in H2 as well . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 11 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 30, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

They 're all , by the way , powered by the same cloud infrastructure . We all build everything at Microsoft with first party equals third party with Azure as the core platform . So what you see us is , in fact , using our own SaaS applications and consumer innovation even to drive the high-end AI capability but then bring the best-in-class tooling for enterprise customers .

Thanks . So overall , I think this is again one of those things where , in the past , we participated in the infrastructure business , but we had a fairly narrow footprint , which is we had our own infrastructure that supported primarily our databases and our operating systems . Whereas with the migration to the cloud , customers are looking for us to be a provider of all their infrastructure needs , which is heterogeneous . And that 's what has really led us at the infrastructure layer to have partnerships with VMware and Oracle . We , as you know , have first-class support for Windows and Linux , Java and .NET , Postgres and SQL , VMware , Red Hat as well as obviously Windows hypervisor . So we -- I feel that we now have that ability to be able to take the entire infrastructure estate , the entire data estate and really add value with these partnerships . And SAP represents the same because SAP", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 39, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

As I sort of parse through the Dynamics within Office 365 and through the discussion around sustainability of double-digit growth within the commercial segment , we 've seen seat count decelerate . Also , the uplift on pricing maybe is n't as much this quarter as we saw in the past , which leads me to believe that you are seeing a lot of success in the front-line worker piece and maybe that 's a bigger driver of the seat count from here . But can you just -- and at the same time , you 're seeing strong uptake of the premium SKUs as well . But as we think about seat count going forward , how much opportunity is there still left on the migration front of commercial licenses versus leaning a bit more on things like front-line worker to sustain outgrowth ? And is there a point where potentially the seat growth and things like frontline could start to eat further into your ability to continue to lift ARPU on the base you already have ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 42, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

Let me break this question apart because you 're actually asking important dynamics that I do n't always think of as trade-off , and so I want to make that more clear in my answer . First , to your question on seat growth , we have room even beyond just first-line workers . Whether that is our ability in small- and mid-sized businesses , on a global basis with mobile-first workers , this is a very broad opportunity for us to reach people trying to accomplish tasks and do their work on devices of any size . And so there is significant room for us to continue to make progress on that front . Now could that end up with some ARPU pressure long term ? It certainly could , but the important -- for me , I do n't think of that as being necessarily a negative . We used to really make no money through these seats that we just talked about . And so every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue , new", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 43, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

And so every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue , new opportunity and new socket for us . Let me separate that from the next dynamic , which is why sort of an average number may not be the best indication , which is our ability to continue to move people to higher-value SKUs , whether that 's through the addition of really compelling things in security or compliance or communications or collaboration or knowledge or learning , where we can add value . Whether we call that E5 or E3 , we have room in that transition as well and new opportunity in a way that I 'm not sure I 've seen us . I feel very optimistic about M365 -- I 'm sorry , Microsoft 365 and our ability to continue to add value .

So it starts sometimes with the customers , whether it 's Humana or Walgreens or Walmart and others . It also starts with partners like Nuance , which is another one that we announced recently . And so the idea is for us to be really ensuring that by every industry we have the right marquee customers as well as the partners and have strong go to markets . One of the things that everyone , I think , in the marketplace understands is Microsoft , especially from a partner perspective , is a great route to market . We have a platform directly with our sales force as well as our channel that is very attractive to third-party developers to get on Azure and they 've realized those benefits . And in fact , our customers rely on that also as a benefit because it helps them get the best value from their partners as well . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Michael Spencer , Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR [ 29 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Oct-23", "chunk_index": 46, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Oct-23-MSFT.txt"}}

We 're off to a very strong start in fiscal '19 , delivering record revenue and profit . Every organization today needs tech intensity to compete and grow in an increasingly digital world . There are 2 aspects to this . Think of it as a simple equation . First , every organization needs to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology . Second , they 'll need to build their own proprietary digital capability . Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity while ensuring we 're addressing their tough questions around trust , both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success .

No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other . Getting this equation right is key to their success going forward . Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help . Now I 'll briefly highlight how we 're innovating across our solution areas . A little over a year ago , we introduced Microsoft 365 to help organizations of all sizes empower their employees in the modern workplace . Today , it 's a multibillion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets . Customers from large multinationals like Eli Lilly to Rio Tinto first-line field workers to small businesses are all choosing Microsoft 365 . Cybersecurity is a central challenge . Microsoft security differentiation is based on 2 things : first , our unparalleled operational security posture ; second , our comprehensive product suite spanning identity , information , application and device protection . We analyze more than 6.5 trillion signals each day , process 4 -- 50 billion authentications monthly and scan 400 billion e-mails for malware and phishing each month . These massive signals generate insights that fuel security innovations for customers . New capabilities in Microsoft 365 detect , investigate and remediate sophisticated cybersecurity threats across every endpoint , saving IT professionals thousands of hours . Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture . In identity management , Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory , and we are innovating with new capabilities to", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Oct-24", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Oct-24-MSFT.txt"}}

Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture . In identity management , Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory , and we are innovating with new capabilities to eliminate passwords for the hundreds of thousands of Azure AD-connected apps that businesses use every day . The future of productivity and collaboration will be defined by AI innovation . And new AI-driven features across Microsoft 365 from automated slide design to proactive Cortana reminders to enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription to org analytics are all augmenting human capability , making it easier for people to focus on what matters most . Another differentiator is Microsoft Teams . Microsoft Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging , video conferencing , meetings and web-based collab into a single integrated user experience scaffolding . It eliminates the need for discrete single-point solutions that only increase an organization 's security and compliance exposure . Customers recognize this value . Teams is now the hub for teamwork for 329,000 organizations , including 87 of the Fortune 100 . And we are adding automated translation support for meetings , shift scheduling for first-line workers and new industry-specific offerings , including health care and small business . Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system , and more than half of our commercial device installed base is now on Windows 10 .

AI-powered digital feedback loops that connect products , operations , customers and employees to create predictive power , automate workflows and ultimately , improve outcomes are key to all organizations . Dynamics 365 uniquely addresses this need . We expect Dynamics to deliver more than $ 2.5 billion in revenue this year with half of that total coming from Dynamics 365 . And this quarter , we introduced Dynamics 365 AI , a new class of AI applications built for an era where the systems of record and engagement are converted into intelligence . Dynamics 365 mixed reality digitizes the physical spaces and interactions . Companies like Chevron and ZF Group are already using it to transform training and design for their first-line workers . And H & M , the world 's second-largest clothing retailer , is relying on Dynamics 365 to digitize its critical business processes . These customers and others recognize the advantage of our modular extensible approach over the traditional SaaS model of monolithic suites or siloed apps . And our investments in our analytics and application platform spanning Power BI , Power Apps and Flow are driving momentum with customers and have made us a leader in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud .

Together , we 'll enable data to be exchanged and enriched across systems , making it a renewable resource that enables new intelligent customer experiences . LinkedIn continues to be an essential platform to connect the world 's professionals with sessions growth of 34 % year-over-year and record levels of messages sent and content shared . We 're innovating with new experiences that leverage the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs such as the ability to e-mail LinkedIn connections directly from Microsoft 365 . Strong engagement across the platform is fueling demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and Talent Solutions , which saw record job postings again this quarter . Talent Insights is a new self-service analytics solution that gives HR professionals competitive intelligence and labor market trends for an increasingly competitive jobs market . And the pending acquisition of Glint brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn 's workforce insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract , retain and develop the best talent .

With Azure Confidential Computing , Azure is now the first cloud to provide a secure platform for protecting the confidentiality and the integrity of data while in use , adding to our existing security protections to encrypt data in transit as well as in rest . Every company needs a strategy to take advantage of the billions of IoT devices entering the market each year . Azure Sphere , our end-to-end solution for securing microcontroller-powered devices , is now broadly available and seeing strong customer interest . Azure Digital Twins is a new service that models relationships and interactions across people , places and devices . We 're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data . Our data services spanning SQL Database , Cosmos DB , Data Warehouse and Data Lake provide the most comprehensive data platform needed for enterprise data estates . Azure ML builds on this foundation to further democratize data and AI to unlock insights , helping data scientists build and train AI models faster , then deploy them with the -- through the cloud or to the edge . Across industries , our customers and partners are using services like these to transform . BMW introduced an agent to redefine how people interact with their cars .

Shell is applying AI across its enterprise to optimize deal productivity and keep workers safe . And this week at Sibos Conference , the Microsoft Cloud is front and center , powering financial services transformation for organizations such as SWIFT , which is enabling secure payment transfers on Azure . Finally , our pending acquisition of GitHub , which we expect to close shortly , recognizes the increasingly vital role developers play in value creation and growth across every industry . I 'm excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos . Now I 'll turn to gaming . We continue to broaden our reach with more than 2 billion gamers worldwide and expand our opportunity from the way games are distributed to how they 're played and viewed . We are investing in content , community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement . First-party content is key to our approach , and we now have 11 Game Studios in our portfolio to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing services like Game Pass .

Fortnite is a good example of that , and all up , we are seeing record software and services revenue and engagement being driven on our platform . Earlier this month , we announced Project xCloud , a breakthrough game streaming technology that puts gamers at the center of their gaming experience , enabling them to play games in high fidelity wherever and whenever they want on any device . And it will empower game developers to scale through hundreds of millions of new users across devices . It 's early days , but I 'm excited about our road map . Across our businesses , we are accelerating innovation , picking the right secular trends , investing in large growing markets , many of which are still in their infancy . Additionally , every one of our solutions is reinforcing our core intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform . Not only are we optimistic about the opportunity for us and for our customers , we also recognize our responsibility . We were one of the first companies in the United States to require suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time-off for their employees . And this quarter , we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave .

Customer demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove the quarter , and we continued to benefit from favorable macroeconomic and IT spending trends . Now to our commercial business . As a reminder , starting this quarter , the commercial portion of LinkedIn is included in these metrics . Our commercial annuity -- our commercial revenue annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 90 % . Commercial unearned revenue was $ 27.3 billion , growing 22 % and 21 % in constant currency , in line with expectations . On an expiry base that was roughly flat year-over-year , commercial bookings were better than expected and increased 15 % and 16 % in constant currency , benefiting from larger long-term Azure contracts , growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts and strength in on-premises revenue . These contract types impact bookings , reported revenue and unearned revenue in different ways . Let me explain . First , under ASC 606 , hybrid and on-premises offerings drive bookings growth and more in-period revenue recognition . Therefore , there 's less impact on unearned revenue .

Cash paid for property , plant and equipment was $ 3.6 billion . Free cash flow was $ 10.1 billion and decreased 2 % year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business .

Thanks , Heather , for the question . I 'll start and then , Amy , you can add . I mean , I think what you 're fundamentally seeing in that overall KPI is what I think our 2 major advantages we have . One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid , right ? So we do n't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud .

The second thing , as you pointed out in your question , is we have a business model advantage . The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL , which I think are very , very unique to us , and you see that . So the combination of the technology advantage and the business model advantage is what I see in the results , whether it 's the stand-alone Azure growth , which is what we expected , and it 's very strong . And the server KPI is even stronger .

I would say the way we think about our capital efficiency and I , in fact , added that even to my commentary this time , which is we 're building this intelligent cloud , intelligent edge platform to span everything , not only the Azure business but also the future of game streaming to what we are doing at Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365 . For the first time , what you see across Microsoft is really one platform , which spans all of these businesses and all of the margin structures that are there represented in it . So that 's where , if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end to end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces because we think that 's what Microsoft 's uniqueness long term lies .

There 's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics , in meetings , in voice , in collab . And I think when you look at the value , I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users , including new first-line or frontline users that we 've not had access before .

That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetized as well . So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter , that 's the foundation of Xbox . Xbox has the key gaming community and the monetization capabilities . Whether it 's first-party games or third-party games , we are best in class in that monetization , and that 's what 's reflected in the results .

You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we 've laid out before , the changing expiry base but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure . And to your point , we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts , which added on a flat expiry base to that 15 % bookings growth , which was good . And so what that means is you 'll see some volatility in that , and you 're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned , specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength , it wo n't land as much in unearned . So when we -- as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure , you 're going to see volatility , frankly , in both of those . But what I tried to do is think about the impact of all the key data points , which is how do we do in quarter , how do we do on the unearned revenue on the balance sheet and how do we do in overall bookings . And if I triangulate between all those 3 just like I did in Q4 , I feel really good about our commercial performance . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Oct-24", "chunk_index": 44, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Oct-24-MSFT.txt"}}

The Windows 10 Pro strength and , I think , commercial strength we 've seen , we continue to see good signs on the commercial refresh . Really security , manageability of modern hardware and software together continues to be a good signal for us . We continue to watch the end of support . It 's really critical for us , for customers to have a terrific experience as we upgrade them and ask them to move to Windows 10 with a lot of value . That end of support is about 5 quarters away , so we 'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment . And it should , to your point , match increasingly the market , and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2 , which I would agree with . But I do n't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrade to modern hardware when they realize the benefits . And so even if you have a tougher comp , I think the demand signal and our opportunity to continue to sell Microsoft 365 in that process and then upgrade to Office 365 as they do deployments is a big opportunity for us to excel . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Oct-24", "chunk_index": 47, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Oct-24-MSFT.txt"}}

We are empowering people and organizations for a world of secure remote work and learning with Microsoft 365 and Teams .

Microsoft Teams supports multiple communications modalities in a shared work space . It 's the only solution with meetings , calls , chat , collaboration and -- with the power of Office and business process workflows in a single integrated user experience , with the highest security as well as compliance . Teams keeps all your work in communication , conversations , documents , whiteboards and meeting notes in context . It helps people collaborate inside and outside meetings , making them more efficient , effective while reducing fatigue .

We saw more than 200 million meeting participants in a single day this month , generating more than 4.1 billion meeting minutes . Teams now has more than 75 million daily active users engaging in rich forms of communication and collaboration , and 2/3 of them shared , collaborated or interacted with files on Teams . And number of organizations integrating their third-party and line of business apps with Teams has tripled in the past 2 months . In health care alone , there were more than 34 million Teams meetings in the past month . New capabilities enable providers like Northwell Health , New York State 's largest health provider , to deliver first-class telehealth . And the NHS in the United Kingdom is using Teams to ensure staff have the tools they need to do their vital work . Now that home offices are doubling as home schools , educational outcomes are at a premium . The combination of Teams and curriculum in OneNote and social learning with Flipgrid give teachers a complete remote learning solution so that they can improve student outcomes . More than 183,000 educational institutions now rely on Teams . In the United Arab Emirates , more than 350,000 students are using Teams .

More broadly , we continue to see momentum with organizations across Microsoft 365 . Office 365 now has 258 million paid seats . Usage of Windows virtual desktop tripled this quarter as organizations deploy virtual desktops and apps on Azure to enable secure remote work . From Interpublic Group and Kohler to Vodafone , the world 's leading companies are choosing Microsoft 365 as their productivity cloud . And we continue to see strong demand for our premium offerings from customers like Mastercard , Autodesk , AARP and Coca-Cola , which chose not only Microsoft 365 but Dynamics 365 and Azure in a 5-year multi-cloud agreement . We 're also expanding our opportunity with consumers with Microsoft 365 Personal and Family , which now has more than 39 million subscribers , and we 're bringing Teams to consumers for the first time so that they can stay connected with family and friends .

This quarter , we introduced new capabilities to protect customer data no matter where it resides . Microsoft Defender ATP now supports Linux in addition to Windows and macOS with iOS and Android to come soon . A new insider risk management in Microsoft 365 helps organizations detect and mitigate malicious activity . The world 's largest hedge fund , Bridgewater Associates , is using security services built into Microsoft 365 to protect employees and core services in a zero-trust environment . Retailer ASOS is using Azure Sentinel to detect and mitigate threats . And the need to secure remote identity and access management is increasing demand for Azure Active Directory now at 300 million active users . Now on to developer tools . We have the most complete developer tool chain , independent of language , framework or cloud from GitHub to the world 's most popular code editing tool , Visual Studio Code .

Power Platform is already used by more than 3.4 million citizen developers and business decision-makers . If you can create an Excel spreadsheet , you can create an app , build a virtual agent , automate a workflow , analyze data and share insights in real time . In just 2 weeks , Swedish Health Services , the largest nonprofit health provider in the Seattle area , used Power Apps to track critical supplies . Thousands of organizations are relying on new integration between Microsoft Teams and Power Apps to share timely information . And governments around the world are using Power BI to share the latest COVID-19 data with their citizens .

Gross margin dollars increased 18 % and 20 % in constant currency . Operating income increased 25 % and 28 % in constant currency . Our earnings per share was $ 1.40 , increasing 23 % and 27 % in constant currency . Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the quarter . In our consumer business , the landscape evolved quickly following our mid-quarter guidance update . The supply chain in China returned to more normal operations at a faster pace than we had anticipated . And we saw increased demand from work , play and learn-from-home scenarios , benefiting Windows OEM , Surface , Office Consumer and Gaming . This was partially offset by a significant reduction in advertising spend , which impacted our Search and LinkedIn businesses . In our commercial business in March , we saw healthy Azure consumption and , as Satya mentioned , increased usage across Windows Virtual Desktop , Power Platform and Microsoft 365 , particularly in Teams and our advanced security solutions . However , we also saw some changes to our sales dynamics , particularly in the industries and segments most impacted by COVID-19 . We saw a slowdown in our transactional business across segments but particularly in small and medium businesses . In Enterprise Services , growth rates slowed as consulting projects were delayed .

Moving to our overall results . Commercial bookings increased 7 % and 12 % in constant currency on a relatively small expiration base and strong prior year comparable . Growth was driven by strong renewal execution , consistent with prior quarters , though we saw some impact from the previously mentioned changes in sales dynamics . Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24 % to $ 89 billion . Approximately 50 % will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months , in line with prior quarter trends . Our commercial revenue annuity and mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 92 % . And commercial cloud revenue was $ 13.3 billion , growing 39 % and 40 % in constant currency .

Now to our segment results . In line with expectations , revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $ 11.7 billion , increasing 15 % and 16 % in constant currency . Office Commercial revenue grew 13 % and 15 % in constant currency . Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25 % and 27 % in constant currency , again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU with strong upsell to E5 .

However , we expect the sales dynamics from March to continue , including a significant impact in LinkedIn from the weak job market and increased volatility in new longer lead time deal closures .

I mean this thing that I 'd always say which is when our customers do well , we 'll do well on a long-term basis , that 's at the core of our business model . That 's the core of how we approach it . That said , Keith , I think there are 3 phases here , and there 's overlap . For example , the phase we are mostly in right now is that first response space , where from business continuity perspective , people want to be able to work remotely , want to be able to conduct remote operations . That 's what 's leading to increased demand in Teams or increased demand in remote desktop and security and what have you . So that 's sort of , I would say , the phase we are in broadly . And of course , there are certain sectors like the health care sector . There is even education obviously as well as some of the public sector organizations . They all have surge demand or even in some segments of retail , there is", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Apr-29", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Apr-29-MSFT.txt"}}

Things will start coming back in terms of economic activity and we 'll have to keep adjusting the dial . This hybrid work is going to be there with us for a period of time . That 's where some of the sort of architectural product strength of ours will be very useful to our customers . Even just take Teams . It 's not -- Teams is not just about having lots and lots of video meetings . Teams is about actually getting work done where meetings and video is one part . So that 's , for example , something the utility of it will only increase for our customers as some people come back to work , some people are remote , you have to collaborate without any fatigue . So that 's that second phase . And then the third phase is where there is going to be structural change . There 's no turning back , for example , in telemedicine , right ? If you look at even what has happened in this first phase with AI bots powering telemedicine triage , that 's going to change , I think , what health care outcomes look like .

Overall , first , I think I would say the current cloud architecture , whether it 's at the infrastructure level or the SaaS applications with M365 or Azure , have been , I think , very , very helpful in us being able to all as an economy pivot to this new way of working , working from home , remoting all of our operations . If you think about it , like the orders of magnitude increase we 've seen in usage , in our own case with our applications such as Teams or virtual desktop , have been tremendous . And that 's happening , as I said , in different segments with our customers as they move to remote operations and are dealing , in some cases , with their own surge demand or what you 've seen even in gaming and other entertainment categories . So I would say these architectures withheld well . We did have , as you mentioned , some supply chain issues coming into the quarter , which have largely worked themselves out .

But outside of that , Heather , it did n't really show a different pattern than I would have normally expected in terms of a breakdown between those . The one difference I will say is just because there was so much deployment done in the past 4 weeks , especially around Teams and some of the other workloads , there 's certainly a distinction that a lot of that was expanding the footprint as opposed of deployment much faster than I think many enterprises had initially planned to do so . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 13 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Apr-29", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Apr-29-MSFT.txt"}}

Overall , the way we 've always approached Teams is as a user experience and , I would say , a scaffolding was to sort of incorporate what 's a modern way of working . We always felt that we needed to have , in some sense , best-in-class functionality in each of the modalities , right , whether it 's meetings or chat , collaboration or business process . But the most important thing is to bring these together so that people can get more done , teams of people and organizations can get more done . And that 's what you see play out even in this pandemic , if you look at it . Of course , there 's no question , meetings are most important . We do a lot of them . But at the same time , what is happening in a meeting is the important context that ca n't get lost .

In fact , some of the stats I shared even around some of the number of business process applications that are getting integrated . One of the most exciting things to me that happened even in this COVID response , people were able to use Power Platform to build new applications in hours , put that into Teams and then get their first-line workers to be able to track , say , PPE because there was no ERP system that did that . That ability to digitize at high rates and do it in the context of how people work and collaborate , I think , speaks to the power of the Teams platform .

These are some of the examples I even used in my script . So this is what is sort of going to be high priority .

There are , as you said , many different ins and outs here . But if you step back and ask yourself , say , 2 years from now , `` Is there going to be more being done in the public cloud or hybrid cloud or less ? '' The answer is more , just because it is more efficient . It is the only way for you to have even the business continuity required in times like this , and your needs going forward of increasing digitization are going to be met with better pricing , better economics at a unit price level for the given business . So that 's sort of what we use to forecast out what we commit , both in terms of CapEx , OpEx , innovation and customer engagement .

Satya , given the incredible spike you 're seeing in Teams and broader Office adoption around remote work , I guess maybe first , given how this crisis has dramatically accelerated some of these adoption curves , how do you think about the longer-term growth and monetization trajectory on Teams and Office maybe versus pre-COVID levels ? And then if you think about your competitive positioning , having both the opportunity to solve remote work challenges from a productivity standpoint and infrastructure challenges from an Azure standpoint , how does the combination of those change some of the competitive dynamics in the market right now ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Satya Nadella , Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [ 30 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thank you for that question .

First of all , as I said a little earlier , Teams and the usage of Teams is something that increases the intensity across all of what 's Microsoft 365 . And to your point about whether it 's -- and usage leads to monetization . Now for example , one of the things that we did n't talk as much at least in the Q & A section is on security . If you look at one of the key considerations , as people go remote work , is to ensure , starting with the identity , to the device endpoint , to the application , to the information in the application and the infrastructure behind the app , you need that zero-trust architecture . So that 's , again , built in to and in around Teams itself . So to me , we have -- and same thing with compliance , right ? So it 's one thing to have Teams , people working remotely . But information being shared in Teams , that OneNote you share , does it carry the policies that were set for information protection ? See , that 's the big advantage we have architecturally in terms of all this having been built with one particular set of architectural principles so that they can be enforced throughout all of these applications . And we 'll obviously want to monetize these as appropriate at different levels of subscription we have for M365 . And so", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Apr-29", "chunk_index": 52, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Apr-29-MSFT.txt"}}

And we 'll obviously want to monetize these as appropriate at different levels of subscription we have for M365 . And so we feel well positioned on that . And to your second part , we 've always said this , which is we do n't , for example , even allocate our capital in building out our cloud infrastructure for Azure or Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365 or even , for that matter , xCloud all as separate . We think of this as all being built on one common platform in Azure . And that 's where our fundamental capital efficiency of that architecture comes from . And yes , from a customer end perspective , we absolutely want to win each layer based on its own merits , and we will have openness in each layer . But there are great benefits . And Coca-Cola and the deal this quarter is a great example of someone who wants to use , in fact , our security across all these 3 clouds and the products across all these 3 clouds . So that 's what we will increasingly do , but that also means we want to be competitive in each layer and open in each layer . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

But even more broadly is that while we 've seen a surge in Teams now , there was a lot of surging in security and compliance 6 months ago and 6 months before that . We 've seen increased usage across multiple products in our line , and that includes Windows and the PC . And so this very holistic and breadth commercial opportunity , but also that extends , in many ways , to consumer opportunities for us as well , is connected . And that breadth , in a moment and a period like this , all the pieces are important to value long term here to a company being able to transition through the phases that Satya talked about , from this initial phase of almost emergency response to a hybrid phase to ultimately what I think we all believe is a very different way and a long-term way of working and collaborating together and driving a digital economy .

Increasingly , these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability .

We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial . Office 365 commercial seats grew 35 % year-over-year and revenue is up 45 % in constant currency . Across industries , customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice . Companies like H & R Block , Johnson & Johnson , Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG , LVMH has all chose Office 365 . And we continue to innovate and add new value . This quarter , we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets . Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers , including Accenture , J. Walter Thompson , J.B. Hunt and Expedia .

We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology . We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel . We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft . These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation . Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console . We 're building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox LIVE community , up 13 % to 52 million active users this quarter . With Creators Update , we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One . We 're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers . In fact , the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console .

At a company level , LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth , which includes $ 371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles . From a geographic perspective , our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends . Our performance in Japan was better than expected , driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions . Our commercial annuity mix was 88 % , even with another quarter of higher-than-expected transactional revenue results . Commercial bookings increased 12 % , or 11 % in constant currency .

Our company gross margin was 66 % , better than anticipated and up 1 point as the sales mix of higher-margin products and services , coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement , more than offset the impact of $ 218 million of LinkedIn amortization . Now to FX . This quarter , the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected .

Let me start and then Amy , if you want , you can add . Again , Keith , I talked -- when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture -- and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud . When you look at what we 're trying to get done between Azure , we do n't really see these scenes across Azure , O365 , Dynamics 365 and also the things that we 're doing with Xbox LIVE , for example . All build as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud . So for example , some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments , whether it 's been speech or vision or anything else . Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again , Bing and other areas . So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together . And that same thing", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-MSFT.txt"}}

Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again , Bing and other areas . So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together . And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys . I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one . While it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365 , but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation . In the case of Maersk , they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365 . So to me , those high-level services will , over time , attach in Azure but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365 . So to me , that 's why Azure is pretty strategic for us , not just for the attachment of high-level services and what is defined as Azure , but the all-up digital transformation opportunity . That 's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure . We need to improve in each one on the elements , but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what 's unique about our approach . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation , the real differentiation is where you 've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion , which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery , the completeness of the business process change or not . And so I think , while I do understand that people ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level , I think what you 're seeing is because we 're able to continue to move people up the stack , including all the way up to the business process layer , I think you 'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 5 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-MSFT.txt"}}

So here 's what we think of . For example , right when everyone 's talking about the cloud , the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud .

Whether it 's IoT , whether it 's the auto industry , whether it 's what 's happening in retail , essentially , compute is going where the data gets generated and increasingly , data is getting generated at the volumes in which it 's drawing compute to it , which is the edge . So if you look at even our announcements over this quarter , a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge . Of course , we have an amazing cloud with sort of the SaaS services for IoT , but the edge compute , the ability to run a neural network at the edge , do inferences at the edge is exciting . Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid . I mean , GEICO example is a good one . What 's happening with SQL Server ? SQL Server is no longer just about a database that 's on-premise . It 's a database that 's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud . Our single table can be extended to the cloud . The queries will work across both the tiering . And so to me , the innovative work we are doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing , which is it will remain distributed .

And in that modernizing phase , it 's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud , but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud . And so that 's the transformation at play , that 's a multiyear and a generational transformation . Quarter-to-quarter , there will be all kinds of volatility , but what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft 's engineers is that we have a very clear worldview of what it is that we want to get done and we stay focused on it . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

Overall qualitatively in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure , a lot of it comes with what 's happening , for example , in the services we talk about like IoT . We now have a much higher-level managed service . We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central , which allows developers who are building IoT solutions and sort of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive . So that 's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services . Same thing with data . The DocumentDB is a massive thing for us . It 's a planet scale database that supports JSON and much more , and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many , many applications .

And that 's a place where we have a very , very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity , which , in some sense , you can think of as it 's kind of like the Office 365 for developers , but that 's all part of Azure . So those are the places where there is PaaS services . But as I said earlier in response to the question , we also welcome the use of , I would say , the most atomic building blocks of Azure , whether it just be a Linux container , Azure functions , which is very cost-efficient for developers because we know that over time , maybe not just PaaS services in Azure , it could be , in fact , a Dynamics 365 module . I mean , the canonical example for me is someone who sort of collects data , does a prediction , ultimately then has to do something about that prediction , which means some automation , like field service .

So 2 quick questions . First off , Amy , there 's been a lot about talk about tax law changes on the corporate side . Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders ? And then just real quickly , on the OpEx side , I know you do n't want to get too specific , but over the last few years , you 've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $ 2 billion from the phone business elsewhere . Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

As you know , I think we 've been -- and executed significant capital return program over the past couple of years , including accelerating a buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it 's created . And so I would n't say that I view those 2 things as waiting for one to do the other . We 've , in fact , continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders , which is to invest in ourselves , acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow , return dividends as well as repurchase shares . And we 've continued to do that this quarter as well . I think you 'll continue to see us take a balanced approach , but I do n't think of those as being related . The last question on OpEx , I think over the past couple of years , we 've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend , are we putting it in the right place for the long term , whether that 's reallocating or adding new .

What Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time , picking markets and making sure we execute in them . So in terms of our ability to continue to do that , of course , there 's opportunities . We learn frankly , I think , every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate . That being said , I do n't view any OpEx number as a constraint . More , I view , is the return healthy ? Is it growing the top line ? Are we executing well on it ? And if we are , it will make sense to spend more , and if we are n't , it wo n't .

And most of the ARPU improvement that we 've seen has been , in fact , still due to the E3 transition , not due to the E5 transition , so we still feel quite good about the opportunity , especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3 . And then in terms of gross margin , margin actually here has been steadily improving . We 've been in this business a bit longer and it 's more mature . I do think , here , the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement , is continuing to raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Chris Suh , Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR [ 42 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- That wraps up the Q & A", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Apr-27", "chunk_index": 61, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Apr-27-MSFT.txt"}}

All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year , unless otherwise noted . We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available , as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed , excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations . At the segment level , we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin . However , due to recent change to our external reporting segments , we are n't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth , and consequently , can not derive constant currency segment operating income either . We do provide constant currency operating expense , and operating income growth at the company-wide level . Please note that in the third quarter of FY16 , we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB , that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation . One of the more significant changes require that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense , rather than as part of additional paid-in capital . Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1 , 2015 , and hence impacts our previously reported quarterly results for FY16 .

Overall , we had a solid quarter . Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results , and what 's ahead . We delivered $ 22.1 billion in revenue , with an operating income of $ 6.8 billion . We exceeded $ 10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate . We are halfway to our FY18 goal of $ 20 billion . This quarter , we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10 . We are proud of our progress , and look forward to making more , as enterprise deployments accelerate . Now let 's get to the specifics of each of our three segments , starting with productivity and business process . We set out to reinvent productivity and business process , because we believe that people should get more out of every moment , and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness . This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in three ways . We can reach more users , enter new markets , and build a developer platform . Let me talk through each . First , we are reaching new users , and", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

We can reach more users , enter new markets , and build a developer platform . Let me talk through each . First , we are reaching new users , and strengthening our productivity platform . Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million . Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately 4 times year-over-year . Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users , and we grew seats by 57 % . Second , we are expanding into new markets such as security , analytics , and cloud voice , where we see an opportunity , and where we can differentiate . For example , the cybersecurity market is expanding rapidly , and it 's a place where we have unique capabilities like advanced threat protection , cloud app security , and advanced e-discovery . This combination drove a 35 % quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365 . A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 Suite E5 . Lastly , we 're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communications service . It 's becoming a growing platform for developers . There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform . It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to email a cup of coffee , or it can be as a sophisticated as DocuSign , streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people 's availability and organizational hierarchy . We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs , and opening Skype", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs , and opening Skype to developers . This is generating developer momentum . In fact , active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month over month . In business process applications , our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios such as IoT , field service , customer self-service , and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics . For example , Echo Labs uses CRM online with Azure IoT , not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently , but also to predict equipment failure , and direct field engineers to respond . And Just Eat in the UK uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for take-outs online . These are scenarios are driving new growth . Dynamics CRM online seats more than doubled this quarter , with over 80 % of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud . We grew Dynamics AX revenue double-digits . Now let 's move to the intelligent cloud segment . The cloud is being built into every organization 's quest to optimize and grow . With our results this quarter , it remains clear , we are one of the two leaders in this market . Azure revenue increased 120 % in constant currency , with revenue from premium services growing triple-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter .

We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform . We 're expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing . We 're generating opportunity for developers and partners . To start , we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in three areas that are top of mind for our customers , artificial intelligence , IoT and business analytics . We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite , our big data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action . It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object and emotion recognition to text and linguistic analysis . The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value . Our new Azure IoT suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications , and acts as the hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets . Each week , more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure . And analytics is another rapidly growing market , where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users . Companies like Toyota , BMW , Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite , Azure IoT , and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industries . Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data from medical imaging systems around the world , helping providers in their effort to transform healthcare .

We 're the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own terms , and we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers , including the recently released preview of Azure Stack , and by bringing SQL Server to Linux . A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data , wherever it is , on-premise , in the cloud , and across all their devices . We continue to grow in this market with enterprise mobility suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000 . This is three consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth . This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services . For example , more than one-third of our Office 365 enterprise suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility services . And as I said earlier , perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers . To this end , we are making Windows and Azure the very best environment for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms . Our acquisition of Xamarin , and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and apps that leverage our cloud , and run natively on Windows , iOS and Android . We 're excited to announce at Build that we 're making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio . Now let 's move to More Personal Computing segment .

We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile-first cloud-first world . In this world , what matters most is the mobility of a person 's experience , not any one single device . As I shared last quarter , we think about our strategy along three lines . First , we will deliver more value and innovation , particularly for enterprise customers . Second , we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform . Third , we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs . First , let me talk through the innovation we 're delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use , trust , productivity to Windows , and specifically more value to our enterprise customers . What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity , security , and device management capabilities in Windows 10 . In fact this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world , the United States Department of Defense , to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year . We see this trend across our enterprise customers , with 83 % of them in active pilots to date . We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10 . The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7 , over the same time period since launch . At Build , we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in ink and touch interfaces , as well as", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 9, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

At Build , we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in ink and touch interfaces , as well as Windows Hello biometric security , and deeper integration with Cortana , all coming this summer with the Windows 10 anniversary update . Second , we 're seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform . Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits . We are excited about compelling new apps coming from Disney , Square Enix , Bank of America , King , Instagram and many others . We grew the number of universal Windows app developers 60 % this quarter . In search , developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana . These new third-party experiences , and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement . Over 35 % of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices . In gaming , monthly active users of Xbox Live grew 26 % year-over-year , driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10 . Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement . At the same time , we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices . Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50 % over last quarter . And starting this summer , universal Windows apps will run on Xbox One , making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices .

Third , we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs . We 're pleased with the results from Surface this quarter . This is our second $ 1 billion revenue quarter for Surface in a row , and it 's the first outside of a holiday period . Revenue grew 61 % in constant currency , driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book . Certainly , consumers value these devices , but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space , with particular strength in financial services , manufacturing , and healthcare . Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers . In particular , they too , are seeing growth in the two-in-one device category . As you can see , we think about renewing growth of Windows , we think broadly about where growth can come from . We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement and monetization of services like search , store and gaming , as well as new sources of revenue from Surface . As we build premium devices and premium categories , we 're also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem .

And this is what we shared with developers at Build , and with business leaders at EnVision a few weeks ago . I hope you have had the chance to watch these events as well . We are creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology , and also new ways for them to build technology . HoloLens developer kit is one such example . Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore , and Case Western University is redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons . Conversational interfaces is another example . We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversation . Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel , or being able to order a pizza through an instant message in Skype . Conversations will be a new platform that every business , every app , and every website will begin to embrace , and we 're at the forefront driving this platform shift . We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business , across every industry to digitally transform themselves , and in turn build their own capability to create more digital technology .

This quarter , revenue was $ 22.1 billion , up 2 % , and up 5 % in constant currency . Gross margin declined slightly , but was up 4 % in constant currency .

Our effective tax rate was 24 % , higher than we anticipated , which impacted our EPS . From a geographic perspective , our performance in most markets was as anticipated . However , Latin America , the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected . In our commercial business , we continued to see healthy fundamentals which led to a solid quarter of results . Commercial bookings increased 7 % , up 9 % in constant currency . Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency , and commercial annuity mix reached 86 % , up 4 points year-over-year . Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $ 18.8 billion , up 3 % and 8 % in constant currency , slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition , and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier . Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $ 25 billion . Most important , as Satya mentioned earlier , our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $ 10 billion . This quarter , more than 65 % of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers , up 15 points from last year . Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling road map . Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45 % this quarter , declining year-over-year .

This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue , our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion , and a small FX headwind . As I mentioned last quarter , even as we 're focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services , our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of change in revenue mix , and targeted investment . In Q3 , the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance , as the recent weakening in the US dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall , and across segments . As Chris explained earlier , we 're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses , and therefore segment operating income . In general , FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total Company level . As expected , our Company gross margin percentage declined this quarter , driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services , in our intelligent cloud , and productivity and business processes segment , offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing . Now to our segment results . This quarter , our productivity and business processes segment delivered in line with our expectations , with $ 6.5 billion in revenue increasing 1 % and 6 % in constant currency , with higher annuity mix offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market .

In office commercial , revenue was flat , and grew 7 % in constant currency , driven by continued momentum in Office 365 , with installed base growth across Office , Exchange , SharePoint , and Skype Workloads . Our channel again expanded this quarter , as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers . Office consumer revenue increased 3 % and 6 % in constant currency , due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue , and our dynamics business grew 4 % , up 9 % in constant currency . We more than doubled CRM online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter . Segment gross margin dollars declined 4 % , up 1 % in constant currency . As we 've discussed , gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment . Operating expenses decreased 1 % , even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and dynamics businesses , and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5 , security and voice capabilities . As a result , operating income declined 7 % . The intelligent cloud segment delivered $ 6.1 billion in revenue , which grew 3 % and 8 % in constant currency , just at the low end of our guidance range . Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year-over-year , and increased 5 % in constant currency against a prior year comparable that had 16 % constant currency growth .

This quarter , our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings , which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency , including over 100 % growth in Azure . That growth was partially offset by a larger than expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business , which impacted the in-quarter results . Enterprise services continued to perform well , with 11 % revenue growth or 15 % in constant currency , driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions . Gross margin declined 2 % , and grew 3 % in constant currency . Gross margin percentage declined , as cloud mix accelerated , offsetting margin improvements in Azure and enterprise services . In response to enterprise customer demand , and to increase our share in the cloud market , we grew operating expenses by 13 % through Azure-focused investments across engineering , additional sales and marketing capacity , and the acquisition of Xamarin . This quarter , operating income declined 14 % . Now to our final segment , More Personal Computing . Revenue exceeded our expectations at $ 9.5 billion , up 1 % and 3 % in constant currency . First , our OEM results . Our total OEM business declined 2 % this quarter , outperforming the overall PC market which was weaker than we expected . OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15 % , driven primarily by a higher than expected mix of premium devices .

OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market , declining 11 % , due to the higher inventory level in Q2 , that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary . Windows volume licensing grew 6 % in constant currency , and IP licensing continued to decline , impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume , and a higher mix of lower royalty units . As expected , devices revenue decreased this quarter . Revenue declined 11 % or 9 % in constant currency , primarily due to phone , where revenue declined 46 % in constant currency . Additionally , sell-through of our Lumia products was weak , and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory . As Satya mentioned , momentum in our Surface business continued , as revenue increased 56 % or 61 % in constant currency , with strong commercial and consumer demand for our Surface lineup . Overall , device gross margin dollars grew , and gross margin percentage improved , primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio . Our search business remains strong this quarter , with growth driven by higher revenue per search , and higher search volume . We again had US PC share growth , and search continued to be profitable .

We saw higher revenue from Xbox Live , driven by both higher volumes of transactions , and higher revenue per transaction , as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios . As expected , Xbox hardware revenue declined , mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold , and lower Xbox One pricing . Segment gross margin increased 2 % or 6 % in constant currency , driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming . Operating expenses decreased 14 % , primarily through our actions in phone , and the transition of our display business to AOL . As a result , segment operating income grew 57 % . Now back to our overall Company results . As planned , we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand . This quarter , we invested $ 2.3 billion in total capital expenditures , including an increase of 65 % year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers . Other income was negative $ 247 million , driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives , partially offset by dividends , interest income , and net recognized gains on investments . Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24 % , higher than we expected , which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies , as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services .

This quarter , we returned $ 6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends . Now let 's move to the outlook . First on FX , consistent with our guidance last quarter , we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points . By segment , we expect 3 points of impact on productivity and business processes , 3 points in intelligent cloud , and 2 points in More Personal Computing . Second , our commercial business . Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth , as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services . Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds , we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $ 24.3 billion to $ 24.5 billion , in line with historic seasonality . We remain on track toward our $ 20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal , as we grow revenue , drive consumption , and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365 , Azure and Dynamics online . Finally , we will continue our investment in data centers and capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services . With that , let me share our view by segment .

In intelligent cloud , we expect revenue between $ 6.5 billion to $ 6.7 billion , driven by annuity growth , offset by continued transactional weakness . In More Personal Computing , we expect revenue between $ 8.7 billion and $ 9 billion . Here 's a bit more detail on its individual components . In Windows , we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market . Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market , similar to what we saw in Q3 , primarily due to the continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices . In devices , we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book , particularly with business customers . For phone , we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4 , as we work through our Lumia channel position . In search , we will continue to show healthy revenue growth , with full-year profitability . Finally in gaming , we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform , and we look forward to E3 , where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year .

We expect other income and expenses to be negative $ 200 million in Q4 . This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense , offset by dividend and interest income . For tax , based on trends reflected in this quarter 's full-year catch-up adjustment , we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21 % and 23 % . We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 20 % and 21 % . Before I wrap up , I 'd like to share a few directional comments on FY17 . This year , we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio , and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business . We anticipate those trends will continue next fiscal year , driving our revenue growth , and impacting our gross margin percentages . As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our business customers , we will advance our progress in our post sale monetization scenarios , and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity .

It 's really , as we talked about , transactional weakness in productivity and business process . We 're continuing to expect strong annuity growth . We 're continuing to expect a strong mix to the cloud . We 're continuing to expect ARPU increases , premium mix increases , and installed base growth . So really , in that segment , it 's the PC weakness , and our traditional transactional office business that 's impacting that segment . In intelligent cloud , it 's a very similar dynamic . We 're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they 've been . We 're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow . We 're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth . And again , it 's the transactional weakness that you 're seeing overall , as well some -- the very specific geo weakness that we saw , which I called out earlier .

Overall , the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 endpoints everywhere and good usage . And I talked about how the mobile endpoints has been growing , and the mobile usage has been growing . I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office . So we feel very good about that , which is users , both in terms of coverage and usage . The next place where we 're very focused on is really the new scenarios , and E5 is obviously a big element of it . I talked about it in some detail , the security value proposition . That is really showing a lot of good traction for us , but we 're also seeing traction in analytics and voice . So we 're in the very early innings of E5 , but the value proposition and the TAM , or the total addressable market of those three scenarios is huge . And so , we remain very excited about it .

But having said that , if -- to your specific question , of where our differentiation lies ? The first one is hybrid . Most people think about hybrid where , they think about the cloud as the edge of their server . We obviously support that with all of our service . Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment rights , whether it be SQL , whether it be Windows server , and you 'll see that increasingly , even in this next wave of servers . But we also think of , in fact , our servers as the edge of our cloud . That I think is where the world is going to go to , where distributed computing will remain distributors . So Azure Stack is completely unique to Microsoft . No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability . So , I would say that 's another point of differentiation . So to your point about margins , I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights . That 's a different margin structure . We will have [ IAS ] services , and you talked about the existence proof , at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there .", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business . First , you 're right . There 's clearly a macro impact , especially on the transactional business . Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets , where we have a higher percentage of new -- of non-annuity business as transactional business . Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment , and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place .", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 39, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment , and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place .

And because frankly , we saw that macro weakness , you 've even seen it , in terms of server shipments , right ? If you look at server shipments , you 'd say that 's actually a macro statement . We did n't see it any one particular workload . It 's weakness across workloads , which tends to make more sense , frankly , with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint . And so , I actually think between those two items , it 's the biggest impact that we 've seen in the quarter . And I expect to see it again next quarter , given I do n't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters . So I think less about it being cannibalistic , because so many of the scenarios in this time period , we 've seen the growth we expected . We 've seen it across our premium services , as well as core compute . I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads , which I think lends itself again to some of those pressures .

So if we look out to FY17 , I know you touched on it a little bit , but just to be clear , it feels like you 're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins . But it sounds like that will be offset in part by a continued good OpEx control . So is that the right way to think about it ?

Those are the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4 . And I would expect stability as we 've seen it , in our More Personal Computing segment . And so , as you think about 2017 , with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix , and actually continued momentum in annuity , I would to see the same -- the same pressures continue to exist . And you 're right , in that our strong operating expense focus , because really this is the quarter when you 've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now , us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our intelligent cloud , and the opportunity we see there across engineering , sales and marketing .

My philosophical position does n't change much . I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter , and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability . What you 've seen this quarter is in fact the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance , than in our -- all of our segments , that is transactional business , that is the most impacted in quarter , by budget changes or macro changes . And so , the inherent volatility that you are talking about really , is about changes in quarter that we see and the impact of that . So I do n't think it 's a philosophical shift . It 's just where you see volatility in quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business . The guidance we gave in our annuity positions , in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly , frankly , what we expected , with the small exception of the geos that I called out .

And as you commented , your annuity was up , and your deferred growth accelerated . That server product line has grown about 5 % constant currency in the last 12 months . I guess the question is , is there any structural reason why , going back to Keith 's question , why that would decelerate more ex macro ?

Ross , let me try to take this . The first question around , is there anything structural or different in that server product line ? Really , it has been , and is that transactional component . You 're right , we continue to see the annuity growth . We continue see the growth through Azure , and the offset to that has been the transactional business . I 'm not sure that I would say that there 's any structural reason , other than -- that 's changed my world view , other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business .

But overall , continuing to see the renewals we 've seen , continuing to see the cloud growth we 've seen , I 'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change , outside of that component we discussed . In terms of overall , rough orders of magnitude , the intelligent cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business . It 's still less than 20 % , but that 20 % , right , lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see . The productivity and business process segment has a bit more transactional exposure , just because it has both the consumer and commercial office business , which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs . So it 's slightly higher , all up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Ross MacMillan , RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [ 42 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thank you . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Chris Suh ,", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 52, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

Amy , you 've been able to grow your Op income on a constant currency basis nicely double-digits , as you 've been investing in the cloud . As you look at the results this quarter , and the -- as you pointed out the Op margins in intelligent cloud and business process productivity that were impacted due to the shift to the cloud , do you think that as you look into next year that the cloud business is at scale , that it continues to grow and take share , relative to overall revenue ? The transaction business , who knows , it could be a bit of a macro pressure . Do you think that we 're at the point where we could continue to entertain a scenario , that Op income could still continues to grow nicely , as it has in the last three , four quarters ? Or is there some other structural change , with respect to the margin of the cloud business , or maybe the transaction business drops off a lot more dramatically , that it may be hard to sustain this nice double-digit Op income , at a very high level without going into the details ?

Satya , regarding the announcement that you will release your SQL Server database on the Linux platform . I was wondering if you can walk us through your decision tree , just in terms of what you think the potential risks are , and what you think the potential rewards are of reaching for that level of openness , if you will .

So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I would say is the increased competitiveness of SQL Server . If you think about where SQL Server now , with this new release , SQL Server 2016 , it 's become a fantastic database for many , many of the workloads , everything from OLTP to data warehousing , to BI , to advanced analytics . For the Tier 1 , this is a capability that 's been multiple decades in the work , but here we are , with very competitive total cost of ownership , price competitiveness , but with a technology that 's in many cases , as Gartner talks about , at the top of the charts , when it comes to all of these workloads . So now that we find ourselves with that capability , we 're saying , look , what 's the way to think about market , all the markets that we can , in fact , take this product to . And the Linux operating system database market is not something that , which is mostly , primarily a Tier 1 segment ,", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Apr-21", "chunk_index": 59, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Apr-21-MSFT.txt"}}

And the Linux operating system database market is not something that , which is mostly , primarily a Tier 1 segment , is something that we 've never worked in . And so , therefore , we look at that as an expansion opportunity , so we take that . We already made the call that Azure for Linux is first-class . We already have 20-plus points of -- 20 % -plus of VNs in Azure are Linux , and we 'll all increasingly have Linux , be a big share of our of percentage of what is happening in Azure . So for the first time now , we have the ability to go to an enterprise , and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux . Now people do n't really move between operating systems . Those choices have been made , but they , at the same time , now they have a choice around database .

I think you made some comments around some IoT applications that are now sitting on Azure . What is sort of a good -- what should we be looking for in terms of new partners ? On , from a survey , ISV perspective , you 've had companies like BlackBox who re-platformed ?

Our commercial cloud revenue grew 48 % , anchored by Azure revenue growth of 76 % . These results speak to us picking the right secular trends in large and growing markets , many of which are still in their infancy , as well as focused innovation and execution . Leading companies in every industry are partnering with us to build their own digital capability to compete and grow . This is creating a broad opportunity for everyone , including our ecosystem . As one example , the co-sell program we introduced 18 months ago has already generated $ 8 billion in contracted partner revenue . Now I 'll briefly highlight our momentum and innovation across our businesses . Microsoft 365 empowers everyone , enterprises , small businesses and then more than 2 billion first-line workers with an integrated secure experience that transcends any 1 device . We are helping every business build out their system of communication and collaboration to drive their productivity as well as their business transformation . Microsoft Teams is the hub for teamwork and a powerful on-ramp for Microsoft 365 , and we 're seeing increased usage of OneDrive , SharePoint , Yammer and the entire Office Suite of applications . Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging , meetings , video conferencing as well as document collaboration . And as of this quarter , enhanced voice capabilities like group call forwarding , delegation , location-based routing are all being brought into Teams .

We are seeing rapid adoption of Teams with more than 420,000 organizations of all sizes and 89 of the Fortune 100 using Teams , including customers like Pfizer , who chose Teams as the collaboration platform for their 115,000 employees , and we are expanding into new and underpenetrated markets . This quarter , we introduced new capabilities to empower first-line workers in the service and task-oriented roles to communicate and collaborate more effectively on the go with mobile schedule management , location sharing as well as the ability to easily record and share secure audio messages . We 're expanding our opportunity in education with Microsoft 365 , innovating in hardware and software to improve learning outcomes from the more collaborative classrooms with Teams to personalized learning tools in OneNote , to social learning with Flipgrid , to affordable easy-to-manage Windows 10 devices . Cybersecurity is a central challenge , and Microsoft is leading the way , helping all organizations operate in what is known in the industry as a zero trust environment . It all starts with Azure AD Active Directory and the deep work we 're doing with Microsoft Threat Protection to provide an integrated solution for our customers that extends across identities , device endpoints , e-mail , information , cloud applications and infrastructure . And this quarter , we introduced new advanced capabilities for identity and threat protection and for information protection and compliance .

Surface had its biggest quarter ever this holiday , delivering strong double-digit growth in both consumer and commercial . We continue to innovate and expand our family of devices , setting the bar for the industry with newest Surface Pro , Surface Laptop and Surface Go . More broadly , Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system . And at CES , our OEM partners showcased always connected Windows 10 PCs that deliver break-through levels of performance to enable powerful new scenarios like immersive gaming . Moving to business applications and LinkedIn . Dynamics 365 grew 51 % this quarter as we win customers with our differentiated approach to systems of record and systems of engagement by making them more modular , extensible and AI-driven . Increasingly , business process automation includes digitizing physical spaces , activities and interactions . Dynamics 365 , along with advances in Azure IoT , AI and Mixed Reality are leading the way for organizations to create these new systems of observation and systems of intelligence that drive end-to-end business processes and bridge the online and off-line worlds .

It is the only solution of its kind in the industry , bringing together no code or low code app development , robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive application platform . And it enables extensibility across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 as well as leading third-party SaaS business applications . With Power platform , Microsoft is fundamentally demarketizing business processes , empowering everyone to make smarter , faster decisions , and I 'm energized about the tremendous opportunity in this space . Already , Centrica is relying on Power BI , Power Apps and Flow along with Dynamics 365 to transform scheduling and dispatch of its first-line workforce in the United Kingdom . Virgin Group is using Power Apps and Dynamics 365 to generate a single view of its passengers ' surfacing insights to improve customer service and increase operational efficiency . And in Italy , postal service is using Dynamics 365 to jump start the digital transformation of thousands of the post offices across the country . Moving to LinkedIn .

Now turning to Azure . Azure is the only hyperscale cloud with a consistent computing stack that extends from the data center to the edge , and customers across every industry recognize this architectural advantage . In retail , Azure was front and center at the NRF . Kroger is partnering with us to redefine customer experience in stalls and provide employees with AI-driven insights , while the Gap chose our cloud to accelerate the digital transformation . And just this week , Albertsons chose Azure as its preferred cloud . In financial services , MasterCard is partnering with us on a new , more secure way to verify digital identities .

In addition , they will roll out Microsoft 365 to more than 380,000 employees in stores globally . We 're accelerating our innovation in emerging workloads like IoT and edge AI . At CES , our partners showcased how Azure IoT and Azure AI are enabling them to build new connected devices and experiences that span the cloud and the edge from connected homes to cars to smart cities . Just this month , Starbucks chose Azure Sphere to secure its business-critical edge devices in the stores . Developers will increasingly drive the influence business -- and influence business processes and functions across every organization . And we are committed to drive at giving developers the tools they need to be productive on any platform . More than 12 million developers around the world use Visual Studio to build applications , and new features enable them to collaborate in real-time and spend more time driving innovation . We closed our acquisition of GitHub this quarter , enabling us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos .

Just last week , we announced our acquisition of Citus Data , the leading provider of PostgreSQL , enhancing our overall data platform differentiation and building on our investments in Azure and making it the most comprehensive cloud for open source and proprietary workloads at any scale . And now I 'll turn to gaming . We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity to transform how games are distributed , played and viewed . Our investments in content community and cloud services across every endpoint drove both record user engagement and record average revenue per user and contributed to our largest gaming revenue quarter ever , driven by software and services . We acquired 2 new studios this quarter , bringing the total to 13 and more than doubling our first-party content capacity in the past 6 months . Xbox Live monthly active users reached a record 64 million , with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date . Xbox Game Pass subscribers and Mixer engagement also hit new all-time highs .

In closing , our accelerating customer momentum is driven by our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies and differentiated innovation across our portfolio . Every company is becoming a digital company , and they 're looking for a trusted partner to help them build tech intensity . Microsoft is that partner .

This quarter , revenue was $ 32.5 billion , up 12 % and 13 % in constant currency . Gross margin dollars increased 12 % . Operating income increased 18 % , and earnings per share was $ 1.10 , increasing 15 % and 14 % in constant currency when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA . Strong execution and continued customer demand for our hybrid cloud offerings drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth . We continued to benefit from favorable secular trends and IT spending conditions . From a geographic perspective , our performance was in line with macroeconomic trends with strength across the U.S. , Western Europe and the U.K. partially offset by weaker performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa . In our commercial business , annuity mix grew 3 points year-over-year to 89 % . Commercial unearned revenue was $ 25.3 billion , growing 20 % , slightly above our expectations . And commercial bookings were strong , growing 18 % and 22 % in constant currency driven by solid renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger , longer-term Azure contracts . As a reminder , strong performance in larger long-term Azure contracts , Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts will drive bookings growth and in-period revenue but will have a limited impact on unearned revenue .

Commercial cloud revenue was $ 9 billion , growing 48 % and 47 % in constant currency . Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 62 % driven by significant improvement in Azure gross margin . Our company gross margin percentage was 62 % , flat year-over-year as improving cloud margins were offset by sales mix shift to commercial cloud and Surface hardware . The U.S. dollar was a bit stronger than anticipated , which resulted in a slightly greater impact to our results . FX reduced revenue , COGS and operating expense growth by less than 1 point . Operating expenses grew 7 % , slightly lower than expectation as some marketing spend shifted to Q3 . We again expanded operating margins as a result of focused investment , solid execution and improving gross margins in key product areas . Now to segment results . Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $ 10.1 billion , increasing 13 % driven by Office 365 Commercial , LinkedIn and Dynamics 365 . Office Commercial revenue grew 11 % . Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 34 % and 33 % in constant currency driven by seat growth of 27 % and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value E3 and E5 offerings .

As discussed on our last earnings call , Q2 revenue growth was impacted by channel inventories normalizing after the prelaunch builds in Q1 but was further negatively impacted by a smaller-than-expected consumer PC market and execution challenges through the quarter . Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 33.3 million , a sequential slowdown primarily due to changes made in how Office 365 is sold in Japan . Our Dynamics business grew 17 % driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 51 % and 50 % in constant currency . This quarter , more than 9 out of every 10 new Dynamics CRM customers chose our cloud offering . LinkedIn revenue increased 29 % and 30 % in constant currency with continued strong execution across all businesses . LinkedIn sessions grew 30 % as engagement once again reached record levels . Segment gross margin dollars increased 11 % , and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as increased cloud mix offset the benefit from improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins . Operating expenses increased 3 % and 4 % in constant currency as we continued to invest in LinkedIn and cloud engineering . Operating income increased 20 % and 19 % in constant currency . Next , the Intelligent Cloud segment , which now includes GitHub .

In our on-premises server business , continued customer demand for flexible hybrid solutions and our premium offerings drove growth of 3 % and 4 % in constant currency . Enterprise Services revenue increased 6 % and 7 % in constant currency , driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft Consulting Services . Segment gross margin dollars increased 20 % .

Operating expenses increased 26 % with continued investment in cloud and AI engineering as well as commercial sales capacity and the addition of GitHub . Operating income grew 16 % and 15 % in constant currency . Now to the results for More Personal Computing segment . Revenue was $ 13 billion , increasing 7 % . Results in our Windows OEM business were lower than expected , partially offset by strong Surface results . In Windows , the overall PC market was smaller than we expected primarily due to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners , which constrained an otherwise healthy PC ecosystem and negatively impacted both OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue growth .

Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remained strong . Gaming revenue grew 8 % and 9 % in constant currency . Xbox software and services revenue increased 31 % and 32 % in constant currency , primarily driven by continued strength from a third-party title . Additionally , strong subscriber growth across Xbox Live and Game Pass helped to offset lower-than-expected performance from other third-party titles on the platform .

Capital expenditures , including finance leases , were down sequentially to $ 3.9 billion , lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter-to-quarter variability and the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out . Cash paid for plant , property and equipment was $ 3.7 billion . Cash flow from operations increased 13 % year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections . Free cash flow was $ 5.2 billion and decreased 2 % year-over-year , reflecting the timing of higher cash payments for plant , property and equipment . Other income was $ 127 million , higher than anticipated , driven by interest income and investment gains partially offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement . Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was slightly above 17 % , in line with expectations . And finally , we returned $ 9.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends , an increase of 91 % . Our Q2 share repurchase was $ 6.1 billion , higher than our normal quarterly pace and aligned to our commitment of incremental buyback to fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year .

We expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to continue to improve year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will again be partially offset by the mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services . Third , CapEx . We expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest to support increasing demand . Now to segment guidance . In Productivity and Business Processes , we expect revenue between $ 9.9 billion and $ 10.1 billion , driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics as well as healthy LinkedIn growth on a strong prior year comparable . We expect Office Consumer revenue growth to continue to be in the low single digits as growth in Office 365 will be partially offset by the continuation of the consumer PC market headwinds . For Intelligent Cloud , we expect revenue between $ 9.15 billion and $ 9.35 billion , with our hybrid demand continuing to drive strong growth in server products and cloud services .

Second , in Q4 , we expect continued strong performance in our commercial cloud business ; but as a reminder , we also have several challenging comparisons from the prior year , specifically in on-premise server , LinkedIn , Windows OEM and the strength of a third-party title in gaming . In terms of operating expenses , we continue to expect full year growth of roughly 8 % .

First of all , thank you , Keith , for the question . It is very true that , at this point , we have seen these very large digital transformational efforts and projects that we are partnered with . And they span , quite frankly , all the industries . I think in the last quarter , you saw in health care , in retail , in financial services . In fact , I sort of internally think of them as what our relationships with our traditional OEM partners in the PC ecosystem were . At this point , some of the partnerships we have with customers are of that same magnitude .

And that just speaks to , I think , what 's happening in the economy , which is every company is becoming a digital company , and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital . From a mix of services , it starts always with , I would say , infrastructure , so this is the edge and the cloud , the infrastructure being used as compute . In fact , you could say the measure of a company going digital is the amount of compute they use . So that 's the base . Then on top of that , of course , all this compute means it 's being used with data . So the data estate , one of the largest things that happens is people consolidate the data that they have and so that they can reason over it . And that 's where things like AI services all get used . So we definitely see that path of -- where they 're adopting the layers of Azure . But it does n't stop in Azure . In fact , if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance , it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure . In many cases , it 's Dynamics 365 .

So the way we think about our overall investment , I think of this as a systems investment because at the scale at which we operate , the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure , which you all track as Azure , you got to remember it 's the core platform that 's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365 , to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course , our third-party business in Azure . So that 's the core platform . And now when you", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jan-30", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jan-30-MSFT.txt"}}

And now when you think about the scale at which we operate , it is very important for us to make sure that every new breakthrough that happens in the system architecture that can improve efficiencies in what is distributed computing is something that we stay on the forefront of it . So that 's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum , and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure . In fact , we are seeing very good adoption in scientific labs , in universities and some pharma companies and others who are looking at really building their quantum algorithmic promise long before the quantum computer [ cloud ] is real so that they are ready to be able to take advantage of that computing resource . So that 's how we look at it , but you got to remember that before Quantum , there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive , efficient in terms of providing computing to the world . So that 's one of the reasons why you hear us talk about quantum as the long-term goal , but you can fully expect us to take a lot of learnings , advances in that roadmap and bring them to market earlier . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2019-Jan-30", "chunk_index": 30, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2019-Jan-30-MSFT.txt"}}

The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge era is already upon us . It represents a tremendous opportunity . We took significant steps this quarter to put this at the forefront of everything we do , realigning our entire engineering organization to accelerate innovation and better serve the needs of customers and partners . With that as the backdrop , I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions . Creating a modern workplace where people can do their best work requires the right culture and the right technology . Microsoft 365 helps every organization empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity , increase teamwork and fuel innovation , all the while ensuring compliance and protecting data from new cyber threats . Microsoft is a clear leader in cloud security . Advanced AI [ releases ] over hundreds of billions of signals each month to identify anomalies , automate detection and help customers respond to cyber threats . Just last week , we announced new value for customers , Microsoft Secure Score , Attack Simulator and Windows Defender ATP automatic detection and remediation capabilities as well as a new open API for the Intelligent Security Graph . We 've also built compliance capability directly into our cloud services . Thousands of organizations are using the recently launched compliance manager with new information protection scanner and built-in classification capability to help prepare for GDPR . Our comprehensive approach and proactive protection are one reason Coca-Cola chose Microsoft Cloud for their digital transformation . One year in , Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork . More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-MSFT.txt"}}

More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams , from Maersk to General Motors . Teams is now enabled for a broad spectrum of calling and meeting room devices . We 're also building AI-powered services into Teams . We 've integrated Microsoft Stream , our enterprise video service , into Teams for transcription and time coding of recorded meetings . We 've added new facial recognition capabilities , which will attribute remarks to specific meeting attendees . And we are adding new Cortana capability to make calls , join a meeting or initiate 3-way calling just using your voice . All this innovation is driving customer usage . Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise , with Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices up 79 % year-over-year . Office 365 commercial now has more than 135 million monthly active users and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million . Now I 'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications . From the start , we recognized the opportunity for LinkedIn and Microsoft to combine forces to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and enable professionals to be more productive and successful . A little over 1 year in , we feel great about the value we are delivering for members , customers and shareholders . Our integration model has enabled LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos . Results are ahead of expectations across all lines of business , with revenue growth of 37 % year-over-year .

This increased engagement is driving strong demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors again this quarter in Talent Solutions . Shifting to business applications . Dynamics 365 is gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine , up 65 % this quarter . We unleashed a wave of AI innovation in Dynamics with hundreds of new capabilities to transform sales and automate marketing , with Office 365 embedded inside Dynamics for productivity . Relationship analytics for sales and marketing leverage the Microsoft Graph and data from social networks to improve customer relationships , and predictive lead scoring help sellers identify and focus on high-quality leads . We 're investing in our business applications platform capabilities across Power BI , Power Apps , Flow and a Common Data model . Now customers can extend Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and quickly build applications using data from across the organization as well as third-party data with minimal custom code .

Our architectural advantage of a consistent stack from the cloud to the edge is resonating with customers , with Azure revenue growth of 93 % this quarter . Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership position in hybrid , developer productivity , trusted security and compliance and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge . We have made the right investment decisions and they 're having an impact , increasing our overall share in an expanding market . Our recent data center expansion , including the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland , brings our total number of regions to 50 , more than any other cloud provider , and the additional availability zones provide the most comprehensive resiliency in the industry . We also continue to see strong customer demand for Azure Stack across industries , and it 's unlocking new workload scenarios across hybrid and edge . Industrial IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing , fueling cloud and edge innovation , accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply chain performance . Azure IoT and Azure Stack enable customers and partners to build industrial IoT solutions that run at the edge , so operators on the factory floor can manage devices and analyze data in real-time .

We 're also gaining traction in machine learning tools adoption with tens of thousands of customers using Azure ML . Finally , we are innovating with new GPU and FPGA-based offerings to lead in AI infrastructure for both training and inference . I 'm excited to share more about our cloud and AI innovation at our developer conference next month at Build . Now to gaming . We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity in gaming from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed . We had one of the best quarters in gaming with strong revenue performance and record levels of engagement . Software and services revenue grew 24 % as we continued to attract , retain and deepen user relationships across Xbox Live , Game Pass and Mixer .

Our results speak to the strength of our platform and services for both first-party and third-party experiences . And we 'll continue to invest in our platform , enhancing our cloud services with AI capabilities for developers to quickly build and monetize games across PC , console and mobile . In closing , intelligent cloud and intelligent edge represents a tremendous opportunity for our customers . It comes with a responsibility to ensure trust in technology . We are working to instill this trust in 3 key areas . The first is privacy . We recognize that privacy is a fundamental human right , and we have consistently acted accordingly . Our success is grounded in our customers ' success . We have been working towards the May 25 GDPR implementation date since 2016 , with hundreds of engineers across the company working on end-to-end privacy architecture , and we 'll ensure that all our products and services are GDPR compliant . For customers , we will provide robust tools backed by a contractual commitment to help them comply with GDPR . In fact , for most customers , it will be more effective and less costly to host their data in Microsoft 's GDPR-compliant cloud than to develop and maintain GDPR compliance tools themselves .

We continued to see healthy enterprise demand for Windows 10 benefiting our OEM partners . OEM non-Pro revenue declined this quarter by 8 % , below the consumer PC market , driven by a higher mix of lower-priced licenses and continued pressure in the entry-level price category . Inventory levels were within the normal range . Windows commercial products and cloud services increased 21 % and 17 % in constant currency from strong double-digit billings as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements . The fundamentals of this business remained healthy , with installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions . As a reminder , under Accounting Standard 606 , the Windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter-to-quarter due to its relatively high mix of on-premises licensing revenue . Search revenue ex TAC grew 16 % and 14 % in constant currency , with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by Bing performance in the U.S. and international markets . Surface revenue grew 32 % and 27 % in constant currency with better-than-expected performance from Surface Book as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio and against the prior year comparable impacted by product end-of-life cycle dynamics .

Assuming the macro environment remains consistent , many of the key drivers of our business should remain intact . Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services .

Sometimes , when you have new workloads and new customers onboard , they start with , in some sense , the IaaS and the data , more at a Blob Storage , but then scale to higher-layer services , like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI . So that , I think , will continue because we 're still in the early innings of the cloud transition . We 're investing aggressively , whether it 's on the field side or on the CapEx side to attract more customers and more workloads per customer . So they will have that same profile , which is lower-margin services first , higher-margin services over time . That 's just inside of Azure . And of course , you combine that with the rest . One of the things that , I think , should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data , in particular , with Azure . So that 's why we think of this as one cloud play , but that should give you a feel for how the customers are looking at it . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation , it 's best to think of it as roughly half . And actually , it 's been going up as we begin to get scale through these services over time , actually . Some of the fixed costs , frankly , even in COGS , tend to come down as a percentage over time . So that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is to that number .

First of all , it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf . I mean , that was sort of priority 1 , 2 and 3 . And that 's what you see in their sessions growth , engagement growth , their quality member growth . And obviously , that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions , talent solutions and sale solutions . We also , during that 1 year , done integrations .

And it 's true that we are , at this point , at scale on Azure and with very , very high growth rates .

The layer about that is the place which we are very excited about . You 've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our high-level services but we 're now seeing some good scale . I , for the first time , talked about Cosmos DB . This was actually a database we just launched last year . I mean , I 've been around databases for a long time . I 've never seen a product that 's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly . And so we 're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we 'll continue to build on that piece . But as I said , one of the key things is architecturally , the way we build Azure , the way we build Office 365 , the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture . And you see that even in the way customers use it . So overall to your specific question on Azure , the growth will moderate as the numbers become big , and they 've already become very big .

But because of the scale at which it 's operating , that 's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows . And so you will see also some different dynamics within that Azure revenue number . Satya mentioned the layers of Azure . If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers , I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates . And some of the services that are more per user like , like EMS within the Azure frame , you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it 's a per seat business . You will actually , over time , see us be able to continue to add ARPU and growth in those segments . Think of it almost like an Office business . Internally , we call that component part of our Microsoft 365 value . That 's how we sell it externally even . And so hopefully , that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 22 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 41, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-MSFT.txt"}}

We 've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices in that choice . I think it 's benefited our OEM partners and us . The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling . I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well .

So anytime a new game , whether it 's first-party or third-party releases , the fact that Xbox is where the best engagement is driven , benefits us . So as a platform owner , that 's a great growth area for us . But we do n't stop there because now we have , whether it 's Xbox Live , whether it 's Game Pass or Mixer , these are all additional opportunities to really serve the gamer as they play more games or watch games on different platforms . So that 's the other big opportunity . But the last one , which I think is new and is something which is already paying its dividends on the Azure growth side , is we 've taken all the knowledge of what it means to go to any one of these first-party titles of ours and building it as a PaaS service in Azure for game developers , and the PlayFab acquisition speaks directly to that .

So let me talk a bit about the components and which ones , I think , are a bit more sustainable and which ones may have a temporal nature to them . The performance in Q3 and the guidance for Q4 shows actually strong performance in a number of places that we expect to continue . OEM Pro is a terrific example for the reasons I just gave in Brad 's question . Windows commercial , which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the security value on a far more annuity like basis .

And I was just curious , do you think , now you have the multi-model database in market , that , that can help you take market share within the data management database space ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Satya Nadella , Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [ 34 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes .

And that 's where I think the opportunity lies . But to your previous question , even there , there are multiple trends , and Amy referenced it in her remarks , which is , for example , virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products . The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers . So that 's one . The fact that we now have SQL and , for example , when you think about SQL itself , it 's a hybrid product . You can tier SQL databases with the cloud . SQL is an AI product because we are the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ , store procedures right in your database . So for example , when we talk about data and AI close to data because computation will always go wherever data is , and a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well . And then there is the hybrid choices where somebody 's building a smart factory , they 're now looking and saying , `` What is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory ? '' And that 's where Azure Stack shows up . So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 54, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-MSFT.txt"}}

And it 's across both Windows in particular , but also SQL , which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio . The first , exactly with hybrid demand . We have something called hybrid -- Azure Hybrid Benefits . What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers , buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid , to cloud over a period of their agreement , is really about their choices , their time lines and their confidence . And so with that right , it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price .

Question for you , Satya . As you meet with CEOs of large companies , this is a recurring theme that we 've been hearing from other software company CEOs , the theme of digitization . Can you help us understand just -- especially given that Microsoft 's growth rate is accelerating , whereas the GDP growth rate is the GDP growth rate . So obviously , tech spending or IT spending as a percentage of GDP or revenue , average company revenue is going higher . So can you help us , given your perspective , which is pretty unique , help us understand , what is the baseline of IT that we 've been operating in ? When it comes to digital business transformation , what are the Phase 1 , Phase 2 , Phase 3 initiatives like ? Where are companies likely to spend more ? And what kinds of products and services that are new and upcoming or maybe you sell them today that comprise that incremental swing factor over the baseline of what IT is today versus wherever we 're likely to go with the digitization of business processes ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 57, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-MSFT.txt"}}

In fact , everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on . For example , how do they engage their customers ? When I talked about Cosmos DB growth , Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources . That 's one example of it . The second piece is , of course , around empowering your employees . I mean , one of the things that now has increasingly become # 1 priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools , the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate . So teams grow .

So teams grow . That 's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365 . The third one is operational efficiency . When we see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth , that 's -- taking every IoT project , it ends up as a field service project . So that 's a classic way somebody says , `` Let me sense something , predict something and then actually fix using field service . '' So that 's a transformational outcome that we 're very well positioned . And lastly , people are changing their business models . You take somebody like Nalco Water . You could say they 're a water company , but now they 're pure water service company . In other words , they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers . And so that 's the transformational outcomes we see . And we feel we -- at Microsoft , we 're well positioned both with the technology but also with our front-line sales capability , service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan , BofA Merrill Lynch , Research Division - MD and Head of Software [ 39 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Apr-26", "chunk_index": 59, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Apr-26-MSFT.txt"}}

I mean I went through some of the things that we even announced at our Ignite Conference . Take something like Azure Arc . The fact that we have a control plane for hybrid computing that is multi-cloud , multi-edge , that 's a pretty differentiated aspect of it . And the data side , both on the transactions on the OLTP side as well as on the analytics side , we now have cloud-native databases . And Azure Synapse , I think , is a very competitive product .

And in particular , I think Microsoft 365 suite actually , and the momentum we 've got in security and management and mobility is a big contributor to that . And of course , just the type of contracts that get signed , whether that 's for the consumption layer , in particular , can have some impact quarter-to-quarter in a couple of points . So there will be some variability in that number , but the underlying fundamentals across both the consumption and per user were quite good . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Operator [ 5 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Jan-29", "chunk_index": 25, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jan-29-MSFT.txt"}}

Beginning in your third quarter or the current March quarter , we 've been bracing for gross margins to trend flat or even down year-over-year , given the sales mix shifts that you and your IR team have long warned us about . Yet when I take your revs guide and your COGS guide , it equates to 3Q gross margins of 68 % , which are actually up about 150 bps year-over-year . So I just wanted to understand what 's going on . Is it that the higher gross margin businesses are decelerating at a slower-than-expected pace in your second half ? Or perhaps the pace of Azure gross margin improvement is greater than you thought ? A little color there might be helpful . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

Really , when you see the gross margin changes , it all comes down to sales mix . So at a fundamental level , I feel very good about the execution of each service to their own gross margin goals . We saw improvement across every cloud service , not just Azure in terms of their ability to deliver growing gross margin as they focus not only on cost but also on continuing to see ARPU growth and attach growth . So -- and I could say that about many of the product lines , right ? I focus on them at the -- what can each products line do to be its best and most competitive ? What you saw in H1 and what you 'll see in H2 is simply mix in Q2 . There was a lot of mix into Windows away from , for example , the console , right , since we 're heading into the next console cycle . At a company level , if you thought about what gross margins would have looked like without gaming , it 's a couple of points of impact . And as we head to H2 , what you 'll see is that the mix will shift a little bit . The sort of end of support impacts tail off , whether that 's in OEM or on the server side .

And they 're trending where we thought they would trend on the per-user-like assets . And what you 're seeing is continued improvement on that trend line that we expected . But you 'll also see as we go forward in time , those improvements will flow at the IaaS and PaaS layer . It will get better but the nature and the sort of rate of improvement will flow . And you 'll see that increasing mix toward IaaS and PaaS in a way from the per user just as in terms of the opportunity and the TAM . So -- and for the long run , Heather , I think my view is unchanged , frankly , about what that should look like . And of course , over the same time period , how it would impact commercial cloud gross margins all up . But what -- I think if you separate this from this gross margin implication , it goes to the fact of just how much revenue opportunity exists in cloud .

And so the flexibility to deploy where they need it and when they need it .

For me , that is a great sign . We 've always said a lot of these hybrid use rights were about investing in skilling and learning and teaching the environment and having the adoption happen for the workloads that make the most sense . And then we can continue to partner with customers to help them through this process and continue to have more meaningful workload transition .

And then to Satya , when you think about just SaaS in general , how important is sort of Dynamics to the overall Microsoft strategy , particularly with what you 're trying to do with the AI platform in Azure because , obviously , over the past 12 months , we 've seen rollouts of some of those insights , AI products where you have --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2020-Jan-29", "chunk_index": 44, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2020-Jan-29-MSFT.txt"}}

That 's , I think , what is needed . And the way we have architected it on top of Azure , it 's cloud native in terms of its use of databases . It 's , for example , all these insights modules I referenced and you referenced are all built on Azure Synapse . So it 's sort of deeply integrated into Azure . It integrates into LinkedIn . It integrates into Microsoft 365 , Power platform , the extensibility model for both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics is the same , which is Power platform .

The question is how rapidly can people and domain experts keep up with the change . And that 's where Dynamics 365 absolutely shine . So we 're excited about what 's happening there .

Today I will share the results for the first quarter and discuss how we are innovating into growing each of our segments . Overall , we are off to a good start in FY17 . We delivered $ 22.3 billion in revenue this quarter , an increase of 5 % in constant currency . I am proud of the continued progress . Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations . At our IT conference , Ignite , I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire tech stack , and how AI will be infused into everything we do . To accelerate our innovation , we 've created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence . As I turn to progress we made by segment this quarter , I will highlight how these investments we 're making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions . Let 's start with Productivity and Business Process . We 're helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps they use every day . We recently introduced cloud-powered intelligence within Word , Excel , PowerPoint , and Outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate tasks , surface related content and connections , focus your inbox , and more easily create compelling content . We are also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers .

This quarter we announced Office 365 Threat Intelligence , which analyzes billions of signals across Office , Azure , Windows , and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments . We 're extending intelligence to compliance with our new Data Governance service , which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention . These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for our Office 365 E5 customers . We are seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises , small business , and consumers . Monthly active users of Office 365 commercials are now over 85 million , up more than 40 % year over year . Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40 % year over year and revenue up 54 % in constant currency . Across industries customers such as eBay ; European airline , EasyJet ; global pharmaceutical company Allergan ; the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance , are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure . Customers love the power of Office on any device . We now have more than 45 million Outlook monthly active devices on iOS and Android , a more than 70 % increase year over year .

They monitor customer relationship help , reveal connections , forecast demand , and predict risk . And the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action , communicate , and collaborate in real-time or schedule a follow-up . Our innovations in Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum . Dynamics CRM Online paid seats more than doubled year over year , and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions , with more than 70 % of the new Dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing Dynamics online . Companies like HP Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence in our latest release and transform engagement with customers and partners . Overall , we are well-positioned to compete and grow our share in this large and growing market . Now let 's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment . Customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations . Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $ 13 billion , and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $ 20 billion in fiscal year 2018 .

And as with last quarter , we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix which is now at 88 % . Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons . They want a trusted , global , hyper-scale cloud provider to meet the enterprise-grade needs . They want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyper-scale service and the cloud servers . They want higher level services to help them build their own digital capability , inclusive of dev-ops , productivity , new IoT and Enterprise App development , advanced analytics , and machine learning and AI capability . These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth . Azure revenue , once again , grew triple-digits , 121 % in constant currency , with Azure compute usage more than doubling year over year . We continue to invest in and expand our datacenter footprint , which now totals 38 regions including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany .

We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200 billion hours of usage . And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and in areas such as gaming . Last quarter , I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy . First , deliver more value and innovation , particularly for enterprise customers . Second , grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform . Third , innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs . Let me talk through the progress we are making in each . This quarter , we released Windows 10 Anniversary Update , with advanced security features including Windows Defender Threat Protection , a cloud-enabled service that helps enterprises detect , investigate , and respond to advanced network attacks . And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities , we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365 . Our advancements in security helped to drive a 3X increase in Windows 10 enterprise deployments over the last six months . The growth in customer adoption is also driving increased developer , search , and Cortana engagement . The number of developers building and updating Universal Windows apps is up 3X year over year . More than 1,000 applications have been developed using the Cortana API , and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users , with almost 13 billion questions asked to date .

Our commitment to grow Xbox Live community led us to acquire Beam this quarter , an innovative and interactive livestreaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time . Finally , let 's talk about our progress in new device categories . Surface continues to drive category growth , and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy Surface , with deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70 % year over year .

This quarter revenue was $ 22.3 billion , up 3 % and 5 % in constant currency . Gross margin was flat and up 2 % in constant currency . Operating income was flat and grew 4 % in constant currency , and earnings per share was $ 0.76 , increasing 9 % , or 13 % in constant currency . I 'm pleased with the strong execution we saw in the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem across both our commercial and consumer businesses . Across most markets , our results were in line with macroeconomic trends , with strength in key markets like the US , Western Europe , and Japan . Momentum and cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88 % , up 2 points from the prior year . We again saw higher-than-expected transactional deal volume , primarily driven by Office commercial products in our small and mid-size business segment . This quarter , the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year , and with solid renewals from that base , we grew our commercial bookings by 18 % . The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $ 25.5 billion .

Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $ 13 billion this quarter , growing 59 % . As I 've shared previously , we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year . This quarter , our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49 % , up 7 points sequentially , although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter . Importantly , gross margin dollars grew by 61 % across the total commercial cloud . Now to Company gross margin . Our Company gross margin was approximately 65 % , down a little less than 2 points from the prior year , impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue , slightly offset by improvements in More Personal Computing . The revenue performance in More Personal Computing largely drove COGS above our expectations . This quarter , the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations . FX had a 2 point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results , and a 1 point negative impact on More Personal Computing results . Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1 % in constant currency from investments supporting our commercial cloud . At the Company level , operating income grew 4 % in constant currency .

This quarter , our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations , with approximately $ 6.7 billion in revenue , an increase of 6 % and 8 % in constant currency . In Office Commercial , revenue increased by 5 % and 8 % in constant currency , as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on-premise business . We again grew our installed base across all key workloads . In our Office 365 commercial business , our premium workload mix was above 60 % . As mentioned earlier , our transactional results were higher than expected in the small- and mid-size customer segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market . Office consumer revenue grew 8 % , also 8 % in constant currency , benefited from a stronger-than-expected consumer PC market , subscriber seat growth , and recurring subscription revenue . And our Dynamics business grew 11 % , up 13 % in constant currency , as customer preference for our cloud services and CRM Online and Dynamics AX contributed to billings and seat growth .

The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $ 6.4 billion in revenue , above our expectations , and grew 8 % , or 10 % in constant currency . Server products and cloud services grew 11 % and 13 % in constant currency . Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services , partially offset by a decline in our transactional , on-premise server business . Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency . As expected , enterprise services revenue growth slowed this quarter to 1 % and 2 % in constant currency , largely due to a decreasing volume of support agreements associated with Windows Server 2003 end of support . Gross margin dollars grew 2 % and 4 % in constant currency , and segment gross margin percentage declined , primarily due to increasing cloud revenue mix , partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin . Given the growth opportunity in cloud , we increased our operating expenses by 21 % , also 21 % in constant currency , to fund cloud engineering , sales capacity , and developer engagement . Consequently , operating income declined 14 % and 11 % in constant currency . Now to our final segment , More Personal Computing .

OEM Pro revenue grew 1 % , reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market , particularly in the US . OEM Non-Pro revenue declined by 1 % , slightly ahead of the consumer PC market driven by a higher mix of premium devices . Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and Non-Pro remained at normal levels . As Satya said , we 're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 enterprise deployments . The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency , as customers continued to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions . Overall , our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and mid-size businesses , enterprises , and academic institutions was flat , and grew 2 % year over year in constant currency . Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter , primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements . Our search business grew again this quarter , driven by rate and volume improvements in Bing . Though our growth rate has moderated , we continued to gain share and scale while delivering profit .

In gaming , revenue declined 5 % , or 4 % in constant currency , due to lower console hardware revenue .

Now back to our Company results . We invested $ 2.3 billion in capital expenditures , a decline from Q4 , but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services .

During the quarter , we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio , which resulted in other income and expense of $ 100 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest , partially offset by interest expense . Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17 % this quarter . As I 've mentioned before , our income tax rate is impacted by three factors : the proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue ; the geographic mix of revenue ; and the timing of equity vests . In our first quarter , equity vests impact the rate more significantly than in other quarters . We returned $ 6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends . We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8 % to $ 0.39 . With that overview of the quarter , let 's turn to the outlook . My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn . We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter . Turning to FX , we expect 1 point of revenue impact at both the total Company and individual segment levels . We expect our commercial business to remain healthy . Though we will still see and experience variability in our transactional business , we will also see strong annuity growth , driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services . Therefore , we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $ 21.05 billion to $ 21.25 billion .

Next on CapEx : we will continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend . We expect a sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter . For the full year , our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY16 , given efficiency improvements . Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment . In Productivity and Business Processes , we expect revenue of $ 6.9 billion to $ 7.1 billion . We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive installed base growth , with continuing declines in our transactional business . For the Intelligent Cloud segment , we expect revenue of $ 6.55 billion to $ 6.75 billion , driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services . We anticipate that Enterprise Services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements . We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $ 11.2 billion to $ 11.6 billion . This segment is impacted by different trends than our other two segments , so some additional detail . First , on Windows . We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned . As a reminder , in our OEM Pro business , we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory . We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel , which will dampen year-over-year growth a bit . In Search , we expect Bing 's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q1 .

Additionally , we expect that total Search revenue growth will slow considerably , as we pass the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo deal , and the associated change in revenue recognition . Phone revenue will continue to decline , and as we previously announced , we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2 . We expect Surface revenue to decline , as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago . And in Gaming , we expect strong share performance in key markets like the US and the UK this holiday , but overall revenue will decline , given lower price points and lower overall console units , as mix shifts towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season . We expect COGS to be $ 9.7 billion to $ 9.9 billion , with variability driven by device sales . We expect operating expenses between $ 7.85 billion and $ 7.95 billion in Q2 , and we remain on path for full-year operating expense of $ 31.1 billion to $ 31.4 billion . We expect other income and expenses to be $ 150 million , as we continue to balance gains on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense and the net cost of hedging .

Overall , again , I go back to how we think about Azure . We really have a view of distributed computing , which is more expansive than just even our hyper-scale cloud . We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric that they 're building . We also do n't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent ; we think of them all together , building out our commercial cloud , because take one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure , it is IoT . But it 's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data . They collect the data , they store the data , they analyze and do predictions on it . But then after you do predictions , you 've got to do something about the predictions . So in many cases they choose to use , especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module , automating field service . So it is those higher-level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating , and that 's something that obviously we did n't make the decision last quarter to do that . This is a decision we made many , many years ago ; in some sense , the inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server era .

Why do n't I take that one ?

Again , Mark , this goes back to a little bit of understanding , how we think about both CapEx as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud . The architectural design we have , for example , when we do CapEx , we are buying the equipment for everything that Microsoft does , which is everything from Azure to Office 365 to Dynamics 365 , as well as our consumer services , like Xbox Live . And you see the growth that we talked about across all of this . Then we have a very common platform , both for our first-party workloads , as well as our third-party business . And so then as we drive efficiency in our cloud infrastructure , when we for example use FPGA to get more out of our network , that 's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do . Then also what we think about as the mix , our goal is not just to sell commodity services , but to actually use commodity services , in some cases , as a bootstrap", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2016-Oct-20", "chunk_index": 36, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2016-Oct-20-MSFT.txt"}}

Then also what we think about as the mix , our goal is not just to sell commodity services , but to actually use commodity services , in some cases , as a bootstrap for higher-level services , because of things like data gravity . So there will be differences quarter to quarter . We may , in fact , onboard a few customers who first onboard a lot of storage at commodity service levels , and then later on start consuming some of the higher-level services . So the margin improvement over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see , but for quarter-to-quarter there will be more volatility , but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we 're building . We 're not just building Azure ; we 're building Azure , Office 365 , Dynamics 365 , as well as our consumer services , which are all cloud-oriented . And it 's the combination of that that 's driving margin .

How we 're doing containers : for example , in Windows Server 2016 , we have great container support , as well as support for things like our Service Fabric , so that people can have absolute application portability , and in fact , people can even tier applications . We have had many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane . So this is an architectural design point that we have built for from the ground up from day one , and it 's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere , and we will take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Chris Suh , Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR [ 41 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thanks , Raimo .

It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure , but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 , and the extensibility of our cloud services across all three of them .

Satya , I actually had a question for you on SQL Server . As you think about the port to Linux , I wonder if you can provide an update on two things : one is just the timing of when we should see that in market , and then two , are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement of across the landscape ? So , for example , do you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL server , moving a little bit away from the traditional thought net development environment . Just curious as to how you are thinking about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems .

And then , of course , the cloud . So it 's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud , with things like Azure Data Lake , that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and both the storage and processing capability they need .

So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you do n't have a real commitment to research , and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn it into products . So the way to measure , though , from the investment side , is to see AI when it is infused into everything we do . Take HoloLens . The ability of HoloLens to be able to see the world , reconstruct it , and in that world to be able to superimpose holograms , that is AI -- applied AI that is working today . When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without an interpreter between languages , it 's using a deep neural net that is bringing together speech synthesis , speech recognition , and machine translation with Skype data .

Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow , from sharing in the feed to video to one-on-one messages sent , all up more than 60 % year-over-year .

You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys as well as in our 98 % Azure revenue growth this quarter . Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency , developer productivity , AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance .

And it was n't just the amazing Azure performance . Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call . Even Enterprise Services was plus 3 instead of flat , and your guide actually suggests that , that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter despite actually a way tougher comp . So I 'm just curious , Amy or Satya , if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance , if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter , any change in behavior . Or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific ? Amy , you called out IT spending signals , so I 'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jan-31", "chunk_index": 23, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jan-31-MSFT.txt"}}

Let me start and Amy can add . For me , it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend . So when we think about the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and then bring that to the Azure business , you can see it at each layer . When it comes to infrastructure , we 're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack . When it comes to the data tier , we have real uniqueness . Take something like Cosmos DB . It 's the only planet-scale database that 's multimodal , supports these new programming models of serverless and event-driven programming . Take SQL . What we are seeing in terms of SQL growth , in terms of Azure DB as well as SQL Server and SQL Server on Linux , that 's , again , addressing the customer needs . There are new workloads that are being born that require both the cloud and the edge , IoT being a great example of that . And especially when you take that in", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jan-31", "chunk_index": 24, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jan-31-MSFT.txt"}}

And especially when you take that in combination with AI , again , you train on the cloud and you score on the edge . That 's a real competitive advantage . We have everything from sort of the life cycle management of how these models get created and deployed and so on . So I think that 's what you 're seeing . There will be variability quarter-to-quarter . There will be mix differences . But overall , when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amy E.

And Chris , it 's been great working with you . Sorry to see you go from this role . As for my questions , one question for Satya , and starting a little bit narrow and maybe running off from there . Gaming in the quarter , seems to have had a good quarter for gaming with the Xbox launch . But more broadly , there 's some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation if you look at the sort of the bases of those 2 consoles . There 's murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console . I know you sort of mixed up the leadership a little bit there . How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus ? And then more broadly , how are you guys feeling about your position in the home , if you will ? When I go home , I 'm talking to Alexa , not talking to Cortana . Is that something that you 're comfortable with where we are today ? Is that something we should see improving on a going-forward basis ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jan-31", "chunk_index": 27, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jan-31-MSFT.txt"}}

So let me take both of those questions . So on gaming , we feel good about Xbox One X , the premium console launch . We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console because that creates the sockets for gaming for us . But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console , but to complement that with the work we 're doing on the PC . PC gaming is a growth market . And so therefore , you see us whether it 's our subscription offer , whether it 's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together and then not stopping there but going to other devices . So for example , mobile . Minecraft on mobile , we just launched , in fact , in the last quarter in China . We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jan-31", "chunk_index": 28, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jan-31-MSFT.txt"}}

Minecraft on mobile , we just launched , in fact , in the last quarter in China . We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China . So overall , you will see us do good work on console . We 'll compete there . But more importantly , we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services , streaming services across all devices . And one other point , I think , I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure . In other words , we have now increasing PaaS services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers . Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox , but it 's going to help developers across the board . So that , I think , will also transcend or lead into even media companies . So we are very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming . So that 's our focus on gaming . In terms of Cortana and home , I think it 's probably important , although the question I 'll ask is -- you asked it narrowly , but my investments are much broader . In other words , I first start by saying let 's make sure our best AI capability , whether it 's speech , whether it 's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2018-Jan-31", "chunk_index": 29, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2018-Jan-31-MSFT.txt"}}

So all of those investments , for example , are available on Azure as Cognitive Services . I even referenced in my remarks how in health care , people are using those to build bots and skills and agents . That 's where we will make sure we do our best building blocks and AI work . Of course , it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent for Microsoft that has some special skills , especially around that crossover between work and life . Most agents and their knowledge of smarts come from the data access they have . In our case , it 's going to be about things that are there in Office 365 : the people , places , things and how we reason about it and help users whether they 're at home or whether they 're at work . Lastly , even when it comes to devices , we want to take an approach that brings all assistants . That 's why we are working with Alexa .

And if you look back 3 years sort of how this EA expiry base works , our performance this quarter was really strong compared to 3 years ago .

It 's also the investments that we 've made to put resources in some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud , and we 've added resources that we 're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way . So that , I think , feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective . And so then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand-new accounts . Are we growing customer bases ? Are we penetrating segments ? And you also saw that in the quarter . So at a high level , you can either sort of add more expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer , and both of those are motions that we focus on . And I feel good about our execution . I think there 's -- and you 'll see that dynamic .

A lot of these sensors today are , in fact , rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud .

So it 's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it . When I think about hybrid computing , at least in the fullness of time , it 's more the future of distributed computing where there is a cloud , there is an edge and even the edge is not just one single edge , but it 's got a typology associated with it going all the way to the sensors , whether it 's at home , whether it 's in a hospital , whether it 's in a factory . So that 's where we 're going to end up , which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed . How and quarter-to-quarter will there be volatility , shifts , changes , that 's all going to be the case .

On the Microsoft Investor Relations website , you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck , which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today 's call . As a reminder , this is the first quarter we 're reporting our results under the new revenue standard , ASC 606 . As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3 , the adoption of this standard had several impacts but most materially , the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts . As we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call , please keep in mind the following : first , the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting ; second , there is no change in customer billings , cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services , hardware , Enterprise Services and advertising businesses ; and lastly , the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change , and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well . The prior periods we 'll reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard . During our August 3 call , we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard , and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance .

We 're off to a very strong start in FY '18 , delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth and exceeding $ 20 billion in commercial cloud ARR , outpacing the goal we set just over 2 years ago . I 'm proud of our team 's work behind these results that spanned all of our segments . We now have 120 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial . We have more than 530 million LinkedIn members . Dynamics 365 customers grew 40 % year-over-year . Azure Compute usage more than doubled this quarter , and revenue grew 90 % ; and Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices grew 90 % year-over-year . These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform .

These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform . Amy will cover our financial results in more detail , but today I wanted to talk about the key areas of innovation and opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond . Our focus is on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for customers by galvanizing around 5 key solution areas : first , top of mind for every CEO is empowering their own employees for the modern workplace . Microsoft 365 is our core offering to address this $ 500 billion-plus market . We are bringing together Office 365 , Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security as a complete integrated solution for organizations of all sizes . It represents a profound shift in the way we design , build and deliver our productivity solutions , moving to a people-centered approach , spanning all their devices to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork , while simplifying security and management . This past quarter , we launched a wave of innovation across Microsoft 365 . The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update empowers people with new AI-first [ in phases ] , ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana , inking , immersive 3D content , storytelling and mixed reality experiences . Cloud sharing and co-authoring experiences are now natively enabled with OneDrive files on demand . We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control , which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes . You 'll see a great line-up of new Windows 10 devices this holiday", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-MSFT.txt"}}

We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control , which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes . You 'll see a great line-up of new Windows 10 devices this holiday , from the new Surface Book 2 to a vibrant range of devices from our OEM partners . This month , we also introduced Windows mixed reality broadly . Mixed reality , which is a voice , gaze and gesture interface , will fundamentally change the way people and teams collaborate . Our work with Ford is a great example of this promise . Ford 's designers are using mixed reality to blend 3D holograms digitally with models and physical production vehicles , allowing them to experiment and iterate on design much more quickly . HoloLens , Windows VR headsets and Microsoft 365 enable any customer to blend physical and digital worlds across devices , empowering people to collaborate in the same shared experience from anywhere in the world . AI is infused across Microsoft 365 in a myriad of helpful ways , making it easier for people to create high-impact presentations and documents , automate routine tasks and search and discover people and content in highly personalized and relevant ways . Beyond new AI capabilities in PowerPoint , Word , OneNote , SharePoint , we 're enabling AI-first workloads like Bing and Cortana using the Microsoft Graph .

With Cortana , you 'll be able to query your calendar and automate tasks like scheduling a meeting or replying to an e-mail using just your voice . Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as a digital hub for teamwork , bringing together conversations , meetings and content into a single canvas . We are integrating AI and cognitive services to make meetings more productive for users today and longer term . Lastly , Microsoft 365 connects users , devices and SaaS applications into a single control plane to simplify IT management while providing comprehensive security across the entire digital estate . Today 's sophisticated threats require AI-based security approaches . Using the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph , we process billions of signals to detect and remediate threats . New conditional access capabilities evaluate risk in real-time based on the user 's account , device and application and physical location . Our leading-edge security and management capabilities are just one reason customers trust Microsoft 365 for their modern workplace needs . Now I 'll turn to LinkedIn and our business applications . From the outset , the priority one was to ensure that LinkedIn , on its own , accelerate its mission and growth while retaining its culture as part of Microsoft . Nearly 1 year in , we are ahead of plan with LinkedIn contributing positively to EPS ex purchase accounting in fiscal '18 . Second , we 're seeing record levels of engagement .

Second , we 're seeing record levels of engagement . LinkedIn is on target to surpass 21 billion sessions this calendar year and has seen its fourth consecutive quarter of 20 % -plus sessions growth . Engagement across the platform is strong , with 65 % year-over-year growth in jobs , visitors across mobile and desktop , 60 % growth in feed update views and nearly 40 % growth in messages sent , driven by more ubiquitous messaging . Third , innovation and execution are accelerating in both the business and in the product integrations across Microsoft , with a positive reception to native video , career advice marketplace and this week 's launch of smart reply messaging . LinkedIn profile integration in Office 365 delivers rich people insights from both the LinkedIn Graph and the Microsoft Graph . The Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics to transform business-to-business sales through social selling . Dynamics 365 for talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution to compete in the talent marketplace . You 'll see more product integration in fiscal '18 as we continue to accelerate our innovation to connect the world 's leading professional cloud with the world 's leading professional network . Now I 'll turn to 2 areas of our hybrid cloud value proposition : applications and infrastructure and data and AI . We 've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud , architecting for hybrid consistency , developer productivity , AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance . Moreover , customers are choosing", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 8, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-MSFT.txt"}}

We 've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud , architecting for hybrid consistency , developer productivity , AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance . Moreover , customers are choosing the Microsoft Cloud for its operational consistency , productivity and security that spans the entire digital estate , inclusive of Windows 10 , security and management , Dynamics 365 , Enterprise Mobility and Security and Azure . Let 's double click on hybrid . To support the emerging Intelligent Cloud , Intelligent Edge application pattern , you need a consistent stack across the public cloud and the edge . Merely providing co-location services or connectivity between on-premise data centers and the public cloud is not sufficient to meet customer needs . You need consistency across the development environment , operating models and technology stacks . Azure provides this consistency across the entire stack , inclusive of identity , data , app platform , security and management -- at the edge and in the cloud . Our hybrid cloud is one of the reasons nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to partner with Microsoft . Costco recently chose Azure as its hybrid cloud platform , and we are excited to partner with them on their digital transformation . Core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage . Azure SQL DB makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premise data center to a fully managed instance in the cloud with no code changes .

SQL 2017 is now broadly available on Windows , Linux , Docker containers with everything built in , including the ability to run AI compute close to the data with Python or R. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database that enables developers to write apps for IoT and other event-based serverless applications . We 're accelerating our innovation to help every developer be an AI developer with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple ML models to powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling in data science . We continue to enhance our cognitive services to give every enterprise powerful building blocks to create their own AI applications . Finally , we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based security built in . Azure confidential computing enables encryption of in-use data to ensure that information is always under customer control , a first for any public cloud . Our ongoing data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally , more than any other cloud provider and 69 compliance offerings and the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry . And new Azure availability zones provide new levels of resiliency for high-availability apps within a region and across regions . Now let me turn to our last solution area : gaming . We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the $ 100 billion-plus gaming industry , broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-MSFT.txt"}}

We will continue to connect our gaming assets across PC , console and mobile and work to grow and engage the more than 53 million Xbox LIVE member network more deeply and frequently with new services like Game Pass and Mixer . And we are a few days away from launching the Xbox One X , the most technically advanced and powerful console ever built . Moreover , we have high expectations for our gaming business to bring more people to more Microsoft experiences and broaden our engagement and usage scenarios . This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in gaming . While we continue to innovate across the console , PC and Xbox LIVE services , we see substantial additional opportunities across e-sports and streaming . At 20 % this quarter , our software and services revenue growth reflects the early-stage potential of this larger opportunity . We also see the opportunity to empower developers who work on console , PC and mobile games to use our cloud infrastructure and services to enhance their gameplay and community . Gaming pushes the boundaries of hardware and software innovation , with some of the most CPU and GPU-intensive applications and content , giving us a huge opportunity in the cloud .

At a company level , LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth and had a 4-point drag on operating income . Excluding the cost amortization of acquired intangibles , LinkedIn contributed $ 78 million to operating income . We are confidently ahead of our original financial commitment for LinkedIn . We now expect LinkedIn , ex purchase accounting , to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year . Our results were in line with macroeconomic trends , with better-than-expected performance from large markets like France , Japan and the U.K. and stabilization in markets like Brazil and Russia . Our sales team and partners delivered strong commercial results this quarter . Multiyear commitments from customers contributed to an 89 % annuity mix . On a roughly flat dollar volume of EA expirations , we grew commercial bookings 14 % and 9 % in constant currency . Commercial unearned revenue came in higher than we expected at $ 21.5 billion , primarily from higher software assurance billings and FX benefit . Our commercial cloud business had another quarter of robust revenue growth and material gross margin improvement .

We now expect operating margin ex LinkedIn , to be up year-over-year even as we increase investment to support long-term top line growth in commercial cloud , AI , mixed reality , quantum , new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team .

When we think about the drivers of that growth , is this just continued share gains by Microsoft enabling you guys to outgrow the market ?

I would say , all of the above . One of the things that we started always , we always believed in distributed computing , and we 've built for that -- so when we say hybrid , we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state , but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to . In fact , I 'm very excited about some of the new workloads . If I look at whether it 's IoT or AI , the 2 workloads that are new , both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation , which is as event-driven computation . So we feel good about new workload growth . We feel good about this lift , shift , modernize motions that are happening . We feel that we 're well positioned for both meeting today 's realities of our enterprise customers but most importantly , where on a secular basis , I believe , hybrid computing is going , which is to this architectural pattern of Intelligent Cloud , Intelligent Edge . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 26, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-MSFT.txt"}}

The way we designed Dynamics 365 both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things , whether it 's CRM or ERP or SEM . Because we realized that , for example , you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure , it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services . And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance , you need field service . And all they need is just a very robust field service module that 's cost-effective and efficient . And so we 're able to attach that to that project . Similarly , on talent , they want to be able to -- if you start on LinkedIn with hiring , you want to be able to do the onboarding and talent management . That 's the module you want . Even on the operations side , we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same , there is need -- with increasing digitization , there is more operational modules that you need .

But we have -- so we do have a very different dialogue . If I -- if you think about it , all of the customers that we have worked with , we have always worked with them historically even in our server days . But to your point , Raimo , I think what has happened is the change , even in the financial services , the segments that you all represent , the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed . In the past , we participated but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack , whereas now , a lot of Tier 1 workloads are , in fact , increasingly on Microsoft Cloud . And so to me , that represents a qualitative change , and so the type of dialogue we have , whether it 's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company , is much deeper , much broader . And I would use the word , we are deeply partnering with them . It 's no longer just simple vendor relationships because as they are trying to build their own software capability , they need a trusted partner who 's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Oct-26", "chunk_index": 53, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Oct-26-MSFT.txt"}}

Accordingly , our key investor metrics do not include the impact of LinkedIn .

Today I 'll share the results for the second quarter and discuss what 's ahead . We had a solid quarter overall , delivering $ 26.1 billion in revenue , up 4 % in constant currency . More importantly , we 're making progress by innovating in new areas , growing our addressable market opportunity , and transforming our culture . Wherever I go in my travels , whether it 's in conversations with heads of state , NGOs or CEOs , the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity . Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their product , service and business model . They 're looking to Microsoft for security , productivity , business process , cloud and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation . In this last quarter we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas , and in particular AI . Just this month we acquired an AI deep learning startup , Maluuba , whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone . With that as the backdrop , I will turn to progress we 've made this quarter by segment , starting with Productivity and Business Process . Office 365 commercial seats grew 37 % year over year , and revenue is up 49 % in constant currency . We 're changing the nature of work with Office as the universal toolkit to help people and teams accomplish more together .

We 're changing the nature of work with Office as the universal toolkit to help people and teams accomplish more together . To that end , this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams , our new chat-based workspace for Office 365 . It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365 , as well as connection to third-party services , all in a secure hub for teamwork . We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers , due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform . And at the same time , customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new work -- way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload . In addition to collaboration , our innovation in security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365 . This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help the user safely connect to the third-party applications . And for compliance , new E-discovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests . Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows . In fact , just eight weeks after availability , we have seen more than 0.5 million people use PowerApps for Flow .

This quarter , the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20 % year over year , a consistent level of growth throughout 2016 . We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction , creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn 's marketing solutions , which includes the rapidly growing Sponsored Updates . We also saw members engage with LinkedIn 's hiring products at record levels as part of Talent Solutions . And LinkedIn 's Sales Solutions have also seen rapid growth , Sales Navigator seats up more than 20 % year over year during the quarter . Sales Navigator 's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson , and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities . The combination of LinkedIn 's Business Solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market . Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter , and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our Cloud Solutions , with more than 80 % using Dynamics 365 .

Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $ 14 billion , and we 're on track to achieve our $ 20 billion in FY18 . Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud of the following reasons . They want a trusted , global , hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise-grade needs . They want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale service , as well is the cloud servers . They want higher-level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT , enterprise , app-to-app , advanced analytics and AI capability . Moreover , and most importantly , CIOs , CSOs , BDMs and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency , productivity and security across their entire digital estate , spanning Windows 10 , Cloud and Security Management , Office 365 , Dynamics 365 , Enterprise Mobility and Azure .

Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016 , and the new SQL Server drove a 5 times increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1 . Now I 'll turn to our progress in more personal computing . This quarter we saw growth across Windows broadly . First , Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10 , driven by the need for a secure and trusted platform . In fact , this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52 % . Accenture , Broward County School District , UnitedHealthcare Group , are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern , secure , enterprise-grade platform . These three commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats , with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million . The consumer PC market is also stabilizing . Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 Premium PCs for the best gaming experiences , logging more than 26 billion hours of game play on PCs and tablets this year . One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live .

Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84 % , even with better-than-expected transactional revenue performance . Commercial bookings increased 7 % , or 12 % in constant currency . Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $ 21.1 billion , growing 8 % , and 9 % in constant currency , even with an FX headwind of approximately $ 150 million , due to the strengthening US dollar through the quarter .

Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48 % , up 2 points from last year , largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage . And gross margin dollars grew again , increasing 62 % across the commercial cloud . We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year .

Second , our commercial business . We expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth , as we expand our install base , grow consumption and execute well on renewals . We expect commercial unearned revenue of $ 20.2 billion to $ 20.4 billion , in line with historic seasonality . We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business , due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud . Third , CapEx .

Continued growth in Pro , driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10 , should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market , with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build . Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market , due to strength in the Premium device category . In search , we expect Bing 's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2 .

The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS solution , excluding the impact of purchase accounting , being minimally dilutive , 1 % , plus or minus , stands . Including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense , as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses . As a reminder , the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting -- one , is it does impact the deferred revenue .

I was just wondering if you could share with us -- given how quickly revenue is growing in this area , how fast can we see margins ramp , which obviously were negative . And now that you 're getting to some big revenue numbers , is there any reason why , at a similar revenue scale you should n't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS -- what you can back into from the financials of AWS ? Can you walk us through the puts and takes ? And then once you hit that scale point , is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly ?

Let me start by saying , we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components . From the IS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer . You 'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365 , Office 36t , as well as our Azure Core and Premium services . So , when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw on Azure , it continues the path we 've actually been on . Where we 've been discussing , as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate consistently , securely , through one interface , you 'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud . It benefits margin , not just in Azure , but across , actually , the entirety of the cloud . That 2 point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really , even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year , certainly implies the improvement that we expected .

Amy , I 'm going to ask another question on gross margins , but this time at the Microsoft level . Your prior guidance was for ex-LinkedIn FY17 gross margins to be down 100 basis points . So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex-LinkedIn were actually up . And if I ran the math accurately , it looks like for your March quarter , ex-LinkedIn you 're expecting gross margins to be about flat . It feels like you are outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before . Are you sticking with the down 100 , or has that improved ? And if it has , what are the one or two biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 35, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

Really Karl , what can drive that , in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud , it 's also really the strength we see in our Windows business . And I mean that , not just in our OEM business , but also across the commercial business for Windows . That tends to have a very good margin profile .

The way I think about it , we really -- Satya and I and the leadership team decided , gosh , about 18 months ago -- it 's been a little longer than that now -- to over-index on investing , because the TM we saw in the intelligent cloud . We increased hiring , and we invested in direct customer acquisition costs , and we invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities in our sales force . We 're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers . That 12 % or 14 % in the server product and services KPI is a very good number . And I continue to expect that we 'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired , and get up to speed , and add value at accounts . A lot of that account value , frankly , Walter , today is coming in the form of consumed revenue . Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be . And so some of the confidence that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense and to even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we 're seeing today , as well", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 43, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

But architecturally , some of the examples are used are about the digital estate that actually does n't start with Azure . In many cases , it starts with advanced [ set ] protection of Windows 10 estate , and then how does that relate to Office 365 ? How does that relate to Azure Active Directory ? And then the workloads that they may want to put , which are T01 workloads in Azure . It 's very similar to what happened even in the client/server era , but of course , the starting points and how this progresses is very different . So we always think at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique in differentiated spanning all of it . So I do n't think of it as margin shifts across the segments , and that 's why we think of all of this as one digital estate , at least from a customer end perspective . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Walter Pritchard , Citigroup - Analyst [ 32 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 45, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

For example , are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads , or large data center migrations , or serverless usage which would enable that ? And separate from that , Amy , I 'm curious just philosophically , how do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur ? Do you think you 're better off matching them , exceeding them ? Or does it make sense , perhaps , warranting a Premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Satya Nadella , Microsoft Corporation - CEO [ 36 ] -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 47, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

Congrats on finishing up a great quarter , as well . One for you , Amy , one for you , Satya . One , Amy , when I look at your comments on gross margin , clearly you 're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin . But I 'm wondering if you could take -- come past your commercial cloud targets were about $ 20 billion . So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best ( abrate ) companies , I could get to about 70 % , 75 % gross margin when you hit your targets . Curious what you think about that . Is that too aggressive , or within the ballpark ? And for you , Satya , as cloud computing moves to the enterprise , there 's some belief among investors that AWS is going to be a big , strong competitor in the enterprise , so just typically not the stronghold for them . How do we think of Microsoft 's enduring strength in the enterprise ? And how confident can we be that you", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 51, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

Then , things like , what we 're doing to even go to non-knowledge workers , audiences in retail or manufacturing , with some of the things that we 're doing with staff scheduling , for example . That 's a way to expand seats , even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker . Of course , we have a significant more opportunity in small- and medium-sized businesses , although we have good , healthy growth there . I think seat growth will come , more from material increases internationally , as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud . Those are all opportunities ahead . And then the last one , of course , is these new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security . So all those three dimensions , there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what is happening , but in terms of our investments in the core product value , they are actually happening on all those three . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "metadata": {"company": "MSFT", "date": "2017-Jan-26", "chunk_index": 57, "chunk_size": 300, "source": "2017-Jan-26-MSFT.txt"}}

I 'm just curious , Amy , with LinkedIn , have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft ? I guess I 'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter .
